The husband is a black-hearted capitalist who bankrupted the heroine’s family. And Si Tian was their cowardly mother who died early. ** Facing the beginning of death, Si Tian just wanted to lie down. The big cub walked into the room with a water glass in his hand, asking softly, “Is mom sick?” The little boy has fair skin, soft hair, and wet eyes, looking at her carefully. Si Tian’s heart was hit in an instant. How could such a cute cub be a villain! Correct the future villain, starting from the cub stage. *** Cub Ji Zhile knows that his mother does not like him. It does not matter, he also hates his mother, fairly enough. Mother forced him to eat the hated carrots and Ji Zhile took revenge in his notebook. Mom played hide-and-seek with him and ended up sleeping on the bed. Ji Zhile continued to hold grudges. Mom went to pick up her brother first and then pick him up today, Ji Zhile held grudges again.

As a result… Going to bed at night: Si Tian stayed up late playing with her mobile phone, and the eldest cub Ji Ningyi sighed: “Mom, stop playing games, you will have dark circles under your eyes.” Little cub Ji Zhile probed: “Mom hasn’t cleared the level after playing for so long, it’s so pitiful.” Si Tian pulled up the quilt to cover the cub: “Sleep!” Get up early to cook: The mothers in other groups get up at six o’clock to make a nutritious breakfast. Si Tian was woken up by the big cub at eight o’clock and drank hot porridge. After the meal, she also quietly ate the cub’s snacks. The barrage was temporarily filled with “Pick up a good-looking and obedient cub”, “Ji Ningyi’s dreaming cub”, and “Ask Si Tian to share coups for raising cubs”. Si Tian said: Mom and cubs, there must be someone capable in the family. *** Ji Jiangzhou did not care about Si Tian and sent one million to Si Tian every month on time as pocket money. The two were just superficial husband and wife, respecting each other like guests. Until Ji Jiangzhou accidentally saw a variety show, his wife, who has always been weak, was stunning and eye-catching on variety shows.

I want to live with my mother and I want to protect her.” The youngest son: “Dad, let my mother take me away too. I will eat less meat and spend less money in the future.” Ji Jiangzhou: ?

She lifted her hand, intending to cover her ears. However, at the forefront of the crowd, there was always someone who remained silent. The tall, immaculately dressed man looked down on everyone like a god, with icy eyes that could freeze one to the bone. He didn’t seem to notice Gu An’s wrists, which were red and raw from being handcuffed, but instead raised his chin in her direction and spoke calmly and indifferently to the police behind him: “What are you waiting for? Take her away.” … … One night, after a week of sleepless nights following the loss of her beloved cat, Gu An suddenly realized that she might be the supporting character in a domineering CEO romance novel. As the darling daughter of Gu Yu, the wealthy hotel industry magnate in Jiangcheng, and with a marriage alliance with the He family, Miss Gu was the most dazzling figure in Jiangcheng’s high society. However, instead of enjoying her privileged life, she bullied and oppressed the female lead, Lu Wan, who lived in the lower city. – She impersonated the female lead and became the fake White Moonlight who had saved the second male lead. – She bullied the female lead, who was working temporarily at a banquet, and poured red wine over her head. – She stole the female lead’s position as the top scorer in the exam and the opportunity to give the freshman welcome speech just for fun. – She made the female lead wear a swim ring and stay in the pool for half an hour during winter. – She snatched the female lead’s part-time job for fun. – She coveted the female lead’s ambiguous relationship with a potential young male love interest. – She threw a tantrum. – She treated people like dirt. … … Gu An had done or was planning to do everything on the list. The powerful young uncle, her cold and distant fiancé, her brother who treated her like an enemy, her loyal bodyguard who pretended to be faithful, they would all become the foundation for the female lead’s success. … … Gu An looked up at the clock. It was now 8:30 in the evening. In fifteen minutes, her fiancé He Ran, who had just found out that she was the fake White Moonlight who saved his life, would knock on her door and hand her a freshly written and still warm agreement to break off their engagement. At this point, the most powerful support behind her, other than her parents, would have collapsed. Gu An: “…” Oh my god, somebody save me. *** Author’s Notes: As an awakened supporting character, Gu An accidentally obtained a system that allowed her to see her favorability level with the male leads and other key characters. – Useless trivia: HE. The original plot line for the male lead and the original female lead (the current supporting actress) did not involve any accidents (note the order). – Everyone ends up in the crematorium, but the extent of their cremation varies. – The old school romance genre is the original plot line, meaning that it is full of melodrama and absurdity. Therefore, the logic and settings are also absurd, and unreasonable and exaggerated plot twists should not be taken literally. Comments that are too extreme or intended to start a fight will be deleted. – The author’s hidden spirit has flown away, please don’t take it too seriously. – The author’s side project (skiing, riding motorcycles, occasionally updating small extras to prove that they are still alive): Rabbit Ji must have long ears."

He becomes a legendary Dragon King, a war god with numerous admirers. Shen Wang is that unfortunate true heir. Returning from the cultivation world, Shen Wang gasps in shock. He’s about to be drained of blood and have his soul suppressed by the protagonist, with no chance of reincarnation. Family affection? That’s less important than his own life. He decisively chooses to flee. Everyone believes Shen Wang left his family because he couldn’t cultivate, feeling inferior and ashamed. They then see him casually selling shabby talismans and elixirs in water bottles on the street.Bystanders laugh: “This guy must be desperate for money to sell such junk so expensively. Who would buy that?” Later… The wealthiest tycoon follows him around, addressing him as ‘big brother’ just for a peace talisman.

Newcomers to the mystic world kneel with suitcases full of cash in front of Shen Wang, hailing him as a boss.

The dark cultivator, with a smirk and a captivating red mole under his eye, asks teasingly, “So, between him and me, who do you love more?” Shen Wang: “……” Help, save me, aren’t you the same person?

The Lin family paid a hefty sum to the noble academy to enroll him, out of sight and out of mind. At school, the young master was ridiculed at every turn.

After fighting with the protagonist for several days, no less. In short, I’m screwed. How can I beat the main character of a modern fantasy? But I have to survive. Like any possessed individual, the will to survive surged within me. With the mindset of holding onto a rope, I looked at my skills. Then, a four-letter word caught my eye. If you’re a dragon, shouldn’t you be able to transform into a beautiful appearance to charm people around, looking all pretty and holy? Well, at least it’s probably easier to move around than a giant body. Let’s look on the bright side. So, I tried using polymorph, and it was incredibly cute! It could easily pass as the novel’s mascot! With just a few cute gestures, it seemed like it could completely charm all the characters inside the modern fantasy novel! Wait, this wasn’t so bad. Rather than being a stranger, isn’t it better to be a small and cute creature? And so, I decided to become the protagonist’s companion monster."

Gu Mingxiao was born with an innate talent for swordsmanship, and looked cold and transcendent, as unattainable as the silver moon in the sky. The cannon fodder had little talent and a despicable temperament. All he could do was rely on his similarity to Gu Mingxiao, beg for mercy amongst Gu Mingxiao’s suitors, and eventually become jealous of Gu Mingxiao to the point of almost going crazy. When Jiang Churong transmigrated, the original owner had just slandered Gu Mingxiao and was sent to the Forbidden Forest by the sect leader. There, he was deceived by the future main villain and turned into a blood sacrifice. At that moment Jiang Churong, who had accidentally released the first seal, freeing the villain, took his last breath after having his blood drained to break the remaining barriers. Jiang Churong didn’t panic. Instead, he bit the tip of his tongue, spat out blood, kissed the villain’s lips, and smiled. “I know you lied to me, but I fell in love with you from the moment I first saw you. As long as I’m alive, I will not let you die.” In the twisted and complicated gaze of the villain, Jiang Churong, who had formed a life-and-death contract with him, pushed him and said, “Let’s go.” —— As Jiang Churong expected, the villain kidnapped him that night. The villain was still just a young man with a sinister and indifferent expression. He grasped Jiang Churong’s slender neck and said, “I know you’re just playing hard to get, but for the sake of our life-and-death contract, you better behave.” In his heart, Jiang Churong was laughing, but on the outside he said in a joyful tone, “Of course, of course, I’ll listen to you.” Later, Jiang Churong and the main villain went through life and death situations together, and became an odd pair that terrified everyone in the cultivation world. The two of them turned the world of cultivation on its head. During this time, Gu Mingxiao became known as the Venerable Mingxiao. One day, Jiang Churong and the main villain were accidentally besieged by the forces of decency. Gu Mingxiao descended from the sky, dressed in white, and pressed the tip of his sword to Jiang Churong’s collarbone. There was blood on Jiang Churong’s lips as he raised his head and smiled lightly. “Eldest senior brother, I hope you’ve been well.” Gu Mingxiao said expressionlessly, “Wen Ling is dead.” Jiang Churong raised his eyebrows. “Is it alright for the Venerable Mingxiao to lie?” Under the watchful eye of the cultivation world, Gu Mingxiao took Jiang Churong away. —— Jiang Churong was imprisoned in an underground palace. He was very calm, spending his days thinking about nothing but escape. He refused to believe that Wen Ling would die like that. That night, Gu Mingxiao came to visit and their eyes met. Jiang Churong looked away lightly, not in the mood to quarrel with Gu Mingxiao again. But in the next second, Gu Mingxiao suddenly grabbed his chin and kissed him hard! At first Jiang Churong was shocked, but then his shock turned to surprise as he felt a familiar aura. He thought ecstatically, ‘Husband, you’re amazing!’ But why hadn’t he known that Wen Ling liked to cosplay? —— Wen Ling was the inner demon that Gu Mingxiao had separated from himself using forbidden methods when he was young, in order to obtain the Dao. He was the dark side of Gu Mingxiao’s heart. Jiang Churong was the bastard that Gu Mingxiao despised most in the world. He used his face, which was so similar to Gu Mingxiao’s own, to do lowly and despicable things. Gu Mingxiao never expected that person and his inner demon would come together. But when he saw Jiang Churong smiling and confessing to the demon he had abandoned through the eyes of that very demon, he couldn’t help but be moved… Everyone loved the bright and graceful Venerable Mingxiao, but no one knew that there was a dark hole in Gu Mingxiao’s heart that no light could penetrate. Later, Gu Mingxiao found Jiang Churong and thought, ‘If he could love my inner demon, couldn’t he also love me?’ Scheming Beauty Shou × White On The Outside But Black On The Inside, Strategic Gong"

He only lost his temper once in more than twenty years, and that was when he sent his ex-boyfriend to the hospital.

Lu Qi was 80% similar to him. 30% similar in looks, and 50% similar in temperament. Then, Lu Qi really saw the legendary white moonlight. The man was sitting at the intersection of light and shadow. He had a handsome profile and a tall, straight figure. His long legs were crossed, his black shirt had two buttons open at the collar, and the hair falling over his forehead covered his eyebrows. When he looked up, his eyes were narrow like those of a fox, with the dazzling lights and shadows of the bar gleaming in them. Lu Qi hesitated for a long time, and while the scumbag was going to the bathroom, he cautiously walked over and warned him that there might be something wrong with the drink he just drank. The white moonlight held his chin and chuckled, looking Lu Qi up and down with his charming eyes. “Is that so? He did something to the wine?” Lu Qi blinked, feeling that they looked nothing alike. The scumbag might have a problem with his eyes. The white moonlight walked straight toward the scumbag, and Lu Qi found that the white moonlight was even half a head taller than him. Then the white moonlight, who was said to be weak and defenseless, raised his long leg and kicked the scumbag in the waist and sent him flying. Well, Lu Qi thought, they still had some similarities. For example, they both kicked the scumbag in the same spot. . . . . . . When he was a boy, Mu Nanqiao disguised himself as a little white rabbit in order to protect himself. He pretended to be gentle, kind, and soft. He watched with cold eyes as some idiot used despicable means to approach him in disguise. That idiot still thought he had deep feelings for him. How could there be a pure soul in this world? In the end, the idiot actually found one. And he sent that person to Mu Nanqiao. He was not a rabbit, but a deer. His eyes were crystal clear, and when he lost his temper, he would use his antlers to hit people. So cute. Mu Nanqiao ran his tongue across his canine teeth and wanted to take the deer back to the fox’s den."

Matching his expertise, Chi Shen effortlessly landed a job as a horror game designer. He joyfully went to work, sneakily slacked off, casually adjusted the company’s feng shui, exorcised spirits for colleagues, and even… occasionally took on the role of proxy head for several prominent spiritual clans. But the second goal proved challenging. The love from his adoptive parents he once longed for, the recognition from his birth parents, and even the family’s exclusive exorcism techniques – all came pouring in. The imposter, who had once led him to his demise and obstructed his return to the family, was now kneeling, sobbing uncontrollably, begging for his life. Chi Shen glanced at his birth family’s home, the debts of blood accumulated by the prominent spiritual clan, and the lost souls in the hands of the imposter. With a smile, he retracted his hand, “Do not disturb my daily life. This is your only warning.” Within his shadow, a catastrophic spirit opened its blood-red eyes, gazing at everyone, and slowly unveiled a menacing grin."

In her previous life, she had arduously climbed up to become an HR director with an annual salary just crossing seven figures. In the blink of an eye, she found herself transmigrated. In this new world, she embodied a character affluent and beautiful, betrothed to a highly learned man from an illustrious background. However, the timing couldn’t have been worse. Her prospective in-laws were all villains who had recently been thrown into prison. Her fiancé took upon himself all the blame, ensuring the release of his entire family. The original owner sought to dissociate herself from this sinking ship by hitching onto the coattails of the newly enthroned emperor. Not only did she kick him while he was down, but she also personally went to the jail to humiliate her fiancé severely. On the very day her fiancé was being led to the execution grounds for beheading, she packed her dowry and, clutching a rooster, defied her entire family’s opposition to enter her fiancé’s now-tumultuous home. The benevolent new emperor decreed that one person’s crime should be borne by that person alone, sparing the rest of the family from punishment but stripping them of their titles and official posts, reducing them to commoners. Her future father-in-law could not withstand the shock and fell gravely ill. The matriarch of the family struggled to keep everything together, barely hanging on. The mother-in-law knew nothing except weeping. Below them were two young twin brothers and a half-sister. Yun Lian led this extended family away from the political strife of the capital to settle down in their ancestral countryside. She saw to it that even the mischievous younger siblings started learning practical skills from an early age. The seemingly naive mother-in-law would soon toughen up under the sun’s rays. The aging matriarch, despite her frailty, proved surprisingly spry when tending to livestock or gathering pigweed. And as for the heartbroken father-in-law, Yun Lian ensured everyone was taken care of meticulously. With her legs propped up, basking in the sun and perusing account books, she found life quite agreeable indeed. In this ancient era, she neither married nor engaged in harem intrigue; instead, she had a bunch of little rascals to manage, which wasn’t so bad. Just as she settled into this idyllic rhythm, her fiancé – whom she believed had long been executed – suddenly appeared with a group of bodyguards. The guards knelt and declared loudly, “We respectfully invite the Queen Empress to enter the palace!” Her handsome fiancé gazed at her with profound affection capable of drowning a person, calling out, “Lian’er~” Yun Lian: ??? (She is perplexed and surprised by the sudden turn of events.)"

When she opened her eyes again, she had returned to the year she was fifteen, just one month before being sold to the matchmaker by her parents. With her rebirth, there was one urgent matter at hand.
Within a month, she had to find a good husband for herself, escape from the Liu family, and avoid the fate of being sold in her previous life. She took all the money she could spare, knocked on the door of the matchmaker’s house in Changfeng Town. And as soon as she left the matchmaker’s house, she met a young man. The matchmaker whispered to her, “Lu Chengxiao, the third son of the Lu family, the owner of the Lu Feng Cloth Shop.” Liu Yu understood; he was her third target. Recently, Lu Chengxiao had encountered a beautiful woman several times and admired her. He was thinking it was a match destined for marriage. It wasn’t until one day when they met in the mountains, the beautiful woman twisted her foot and couldn’t move so he carried her all the way. When he returned to deliver the medicine, he saw the beautiful woman walking lightly, with no sign of a twisted foot. The heat behind his ears receded, and his eyes grew colder. He turned and went back to Changfeng Town. Several days later, the beautiful woman shyly handed him a purse, thanking him for his help. Lu Chengxiao sneered, “Thanking me for helping? That day, I turned back and saw the lady walking normally. Why would I need to help?” “I can’t accept this purse. If we privately exchange gifts, it might be hard to explain later. It’s better for the lady to keep her dignity.” Alright, this one couldn’t work. Liu Yu took back the purse, curtsied, and walked away… Lu Chengxiao thought it was a decisive rejection, until several days later, he saw Liu Yu drop an embroidered handkerchief in front of the bookshop where the young man, Chen Sheng, worked. The gentleman picked up the scented handkerchief, and the beautiful woman blushed and thanked him. What a beautiful encounter. Lu Chengxiao: “…” A wave of frustration welled up in his chest, and he clenched his teeth as he tossed and turned in his dreams. Until later, when he saw Liu Yu about to stage a falling-into-the-water scene, Lu Chengxiao panicked. He jumped into the river before Chen Sheng, pulled her ashore, held her slender waist, and couldn’t help but feel both angry and pained. He didn’t even want to ask more questions. He just held her in his arms and almost begged, “Don’t you want a good marriage? I’ll marry you!” 【This is a story that begins with scheming, falls into love, with a heart full of sincerity, and ends up in a marriage.

Here, he went from being unknown to becoming the brightest star on the big screen. At the same time, he also touched the star that belonged to him. — Shen Tingyan was one of the four mentors of the show ‘Studio Superstar,’ and his first impression of Xue Xiao was that of a shy, studious contestant who carefully watched every scene with wide eyes. The second time he saw Xue Xiao, he found that even if this young man had no one to act with him, he could use the little flowers on the roadside, the air in front of him, or the kitten taking a nap in front of him as his scene partners to practice his lines diligently. There might be a bit of shyness, but he was entirely focused once immersed in it. The third time he saw Xue Xiao, the young man was lying in a corner of the studio and sleeping in a daze. The script he held in his arms was full of his previous comments on the scene, and a cute chibi version of a person was drawn next to it. This little person inexplicably looked like him, which made Shen Tingyan fall into deep thought. The fourth time he saw Xue Xiao… The little guy was peeking at him. Once Xue Xiao was caught, he buried his head in a panic and pretended that nothing had happened. However, his ears were so red that they seemed to be dripping blood. Shen Tingyan stared at the crimson color, paused, and drew a horizontal line on his script. He inexplicably decided that he would make a note of it every time he caught Xue Xiao peeking at him in the future. Then he found that he had drawn a full ten ‘正’ characters in just one day. Shen Tingyan finally couldn’t help laughing. — Xue Xiao’s starting point was a passerby corpse on the battlefield. Later, he became a dejected young man drunk by the side of the road, a high-spirited young general, a lonely mute, a dissolute wastrel… He ran all the way to the brightest night sky. On the day he stepped on the Best Actor’s podium at the age of 25, the one who handed him the trophy was Shen Tingyan, who accompanied him all the way. Shen Tingyan asked him with a smile, “What do you want to do most now?” Xue Xiao faced this man, pursed his lips, and smiled. “I have already obtained what I want most.” “What about you?” “I want to hold the star in my hand now,” the man said."

Until a torrential rainstorm and flood struck, he was swept away by the flood while trying to rescue children in the village. When he opened his eyes again, he had become Xu Ge’er, a character in ancient rural life. Who is Xu Ge’er? He is a character from the book “The General’s Pretty Wife”, someone who once hailed from the same hometown as the general, someone who stirred the general’s heart, and someone who refused the general’s blind pursuit. He is like an old ox, working tirelessly and diligently, doing the most work and eating the least, worn out by labor but despised by his parents at home for not marrying into a good family and not having more children. He is Xu Ge’er who supported his husband to become a scholar but was abandoned with a divorce letter in the end. He is the one who raised his younger siblings but was looked down upon by them as a poor relative from the countryside. He died alone in a mud house, buried hastily with only a straw mat by the village folks. Tang Xu sat on the hard stone bed, feeling bitterly wronged. Listening to his mother’s curses, Tang Xu forcefully broke the chicken’s neck with his hands. Looking at his siblings who only knew how to eat meat but not help with work, Tang Xu narrowed his eyes. If they wanted meat, they had to work for it. Tang Xu, quickly accepting his current identity, decided to adapt to it. Since he was given a second chance at life, he would live comfortably as he pleased. As for other matters, like men having children, he wouldn’t dwell on them. Approaching the age to marry? Alright, he’ll marry that Orion from the neighboring village. Although there was a sick younger brother at home, the hunter was strong and good at work. Tang Xu chewed on a piece of grass, happily patting the Orion’s chest muscles and asked with a smile, “Will you marry me?” The Orion looked at Tang Xu’s face, which was considered outstanding in the vicinity, blushed, and nodded: “Yes!”"

When these creatures who were fortunate enough to have magic in their lives were in a good mood, they might tell humans a couple of magical wonders. Most creatures that use magic simply repeat these limited spells. Only a few exceptionally talented sages are able to invent their own spells, and they are called “Magic Weavers.” “Fundamentals of Magic” is a book that delves into theories of magic, discussing the conversion of energy between magical energy, kinetic energy, potential energy, and thermal energy. The first author of this book, Magic Weaver Sylas, was the first Magic Weaver among humans. The corresponding author of the book is Sylas’s teacher, Elemental Archmage Xerath. It was just a mistake in the library’s search system, as it mistook “Sylas” and “Xerath” as content keywords instead of author keywords. But why did it bring up a book called “Tower of Blossoming Desires”? Out of curiosity, I followed the sign and found this book in a bookcase that was as big as a whole wall, filled with third-rate romance novels.

She had always considered it her duty to eliminate demons and protect the Dao. Usually, she would dispatch these kinds of creatures with a single sword strike, but now, her severe injuries made it difficult to mobilize her spiritual energy. A slight misstep during her healing process could lead to demonic possession. Helpless, Ji Yuebai could only watch as the jade-green little snake swam towards her across the water and wrapped itself around her body. She made up her mind that as soon as her wounds healed a bit, she would cut this creature into a thousand pieces. However, the little green snake, unaware of the impending disaster, fl**ked its pink tongue unconsciously. It just so happened to touch Ji Yuebai’s ears, as smooth and lustrous as pearls and jade, and suddenly found that the body beneath it started shaking uncontrollably. It’s often said that snakes are naturally lustful, and demon snakes even more so. Ji Yuebai could no longer bear such a humiliation. What if she succumbed to demonic influences? She attempted to channel her spiritual energy into her sword, but at that moment, an icy sensation came from her wounds, providing temporary relief from the pain. She then saw the green snake’s slender tail gently applying a sacred healing herb, which hadn’t touched water, to her wounds. … Ji Yuebai, the junior master from Tian Yuan Sect, who was always at odds with the demonic path, caused quite a stir in the sect when she returned from her training with a snake demon in tow. Many people in the sect thought Ji Yuebai had lost her mind. Even more self-proclaimed warriors of justice, under the banner of demon-slaying and protecting the Dao, demanded the death of the little green snake, branding it a vile creature of evil. That is, until Ji Yuebai stood on the Life and Death stage, shaking the fresh red blood from her sword, and said coldly: “Is there anyone else who objects? Let them speak on the stage of life and death.” From that moment on, no one in the sect dared to bring up this matter again. … The little green snake followed Ji Yuebai in her daily cultivation. When Ji Yuebai got up, it did too; when Ji Yuebai rested, it would curl up into a ball in her arms and rest with her. The unrivaled swordmaster of Tian Yuan Sect, Ji Yuebai, finally had a companion. Many noticed that the Shishu, who used to have a stern face every day, now had much softer corners to her lips. Until one day, Ji Yuebai woke up to a gentle, silky touch. She looked down to see an exquisitely beautiful woman with green snake skin softly curled up in her arms, her wrist resting on her waist in an almost boneless manner, and her voice was utterly captivating: “Yuebai, I’ve transformed~” It was then that the always single-minded Ji Yuebai understood the true meaning of the term “demon.”"

The young man gently caressed his beautiful green eyes, “From now on, you’ll be called Ah Fei.” But no one expected that many years later, Ah Fei would become the only king of a different surname in the Zhou Dynasty, with great and impressive military exploits, shocking the land under heaven. At that time, the emperor was old, sick, and weak, and his princes suddenly died one after another. The king with a different surname seemed to have the intention of usurping the throne, leaving everyone’s hearts in the royal court and the court of law panicking. The imprisoned Zhou Huaiyan sighed—— The unscrupulous indulgence of his youth has now become the most shameful past for this God of War. Maybe he will be the one who dies the most tragically among the princes. But in the end, Zhou Huaiyan didn’t expect that the ice-cold blade he had been waiting for did not come, rather, it was the imperial jade seal with all the bloodstains washed away. “Master……” The tall and beautiful foreign man crawled at his feet, looking as obedient and attached as a cat. “Touch this s*ave, please…” —— Everyone in the court and the commons knows that the king with a different surname who is now in power was just a lowly s*ave for Zhou Huaiyan to play with. “So this is how you take revenge on me,” The young man in the golden cage raised his head and gazed at the foreign man’s bulging belly with complicated eyes. “By locking me up just to get you pregnant?” 【Sensitive • Extremely low self-esteem • Full force value • Curly-haired cat shou】 【Salted fish • Lordly, Luxury-loving, loose-living, and idle • Cat owner • Full beauty value • Little sweetheart gong】 【Mine clearance: Shou is an inter**x, mpreg, the initial favorability of the gong is 100%, and the gong is a modern man who has transmigrated through time】 Content tags: mpreg, court officials, soft spot, royal court, relaxing One-sentence introduction: Peerless beauty gong"

Feeling confused, Qiao Yu can only write in her story: “Love is a hand that wants to touch but pulls back, and the appropriate distance brings them closer.” She also wants to depict the emotional progress of the male and female protagonists during their travels, but throughout the entire trip, they separate and she ends up spending her time with the female protagonist, going out during the day and soaking in hot springs at night. The only thing she knows for certain is that the female protagonist has a nice figure, but she doesn’t dare write about it in the story. The story progresses slowly with extensive psychological descriptions, and both orbs’ values remain stable. The comments section is filled with praise, hailing her as a writer who excels in portraying delicate emotions. Only Qiao Yu knows that she has nothing to write about, and she laments quietly, “Why is the progress so slow?” While Qiao Yu is lost in her thoughts, Lin Qing, who is feeding her dried fruits, suddenly grabs the back of her head and kisses her. After a moment, Lin Qing releases her and reveals a deep, night-like gaze in her usually clear eyes. She softly smiles and asks, “Is it still slow now?” Qiao Yu completely freezes, and in her mind, the two orbs from the writing interface and the clear classification of “romance” appear vividly. It’s over—she has unintentionally turned her romance novel into a yuri story! Her life is surely over today!"

He was clear, elegant, with straight eyebrows and star like eyes. He was the most handsome boy in school, and was the dream boyfriend of all girls in school. But for Bai Xunyin, Yu Luoyin was the first to protect her, smile at her, discuss topics with her, and the person who had lunch with her.

Under Yu Luoyin’s gentle, elegant and handsome appearance was a scumbag. He faced his two tr*shy friends, smiled and said-“The little mute started to like me. Our bet ends here, I’m bored of staying with her.” Bai Xunyin could not speak, but her eyes knew how to cry. Since then, she never looked directly at Yu Luoyin again. Afterwards Young Master Yu ridiculed her, mocked her, broke a table, apologized, and even hurt himself, he used various methods but it was still useless.

For the rest of my life, I will never dare to do this again.” *You are my unspeakable incurable pain. It hurts when I think of you, but it hurts even more when I can’t think of you."

I stared at the man who kissed me just now.

I was instantly bewitched. I couldn’t look away, as if there was an irresistible force coveting my gaze. Because he’s so handsome. “Rosé, how long do we have to do this?” I shuddered as the sweet voice whispered next to my ear. Only then did I come to my senses.
I laughed awkwardly to fill the silence. Ahaha, I really don’t know… “I-I think we can stop now.” At my words, Albert grinned. It was the forced, soulless smile of a sales team member. Nonetheless, he was still breathtakingly beautiful. “Then, can I see it now?”
“…Yes.” He took the wand that I had been holding.

He saw a graceful figure in a single glance, and fell deeply in love. He was in unrequited love with Princess Huining for many years. Afterwards, he followed his father to guard the borders, and captured eighteen Beijiang cities, despite his young age. He returned in victory. All of it was for the sake of asking for Princess Huining’s hand in marriage. Before, Huining’s mother had been ruined. Huining was thin and reclusive, having suffered neglect and humiliation. Yet she was still cold and unbending, like a pearl fallen in the mire. Now, she was in the bloom of youth, striding through the palace with a vibrant crown. Her suitors filled the palace to bursting, yet no one could catch her eye. That day, an imperial edict was declared to the realm, and the princess’s refusal was not allowed. That night, the light of the red candles swayed, and a razor-sharp dagger met Fang Linyuan’s neck. “Listen to my orders, or you’ll die without a complete corpse.” Beneath the veil sounded the cold and unfamiliar voice of a young man. *** Fang Linyuan received his long-sought wish, but the angel he dreamed of marrying as a boy turned out to be a man. It turned out that Princess Huining, Zhao Chu, had been in disguise for many years, enduring humiliation and trials, just in order to protect himself in a den of tigers. He was waiting for a chance to take power and steal the throne. And his marriage was nothing more than another layer of his disguise. Fang Linyuan had nowhere to express his bitterness. He could only swallow his resentment and tuck away the sincerity he had paid in vain, wanting nothing more than to never see the false princess again. But the marriage certificate was already written, and not only did he have to see Zhao Chu day after day, but he also had to put on a show of harmony and mutual respect with the false princess. Fang Linyuan could only suffer patiently, being Zhao Chu’s false husband on one hand while waiting for war to arise on the other. Once it did, he would lead an army out of the capital, never to return. But before the fires of war arose, there came the day when Princess Huining took power. The throne was beneath him, and the officials bowed to him. Zhao Chu no longer needed to be Madam Fang. Fang Linyuan offered him divorce papers, intending to retire from the capital and guard the borders. Yet he saw Zhao Chu rip the divorce papers into tiny pieces with a cold expression, his eyes forbidding. Zhao Chu asked him why he started this mess only to abandon it at the end. “But you’re a man,” Fang Linyuan explained. Beneath the red candles, Zhao Chu’s face was luminous, just as when he had first seen him. “Men have their good points.”"

As a prophet, I thought my role was just to warn the main characters and then exit the scene, but… An alien creature, known only as Monster X, has taken an unsettling interest in me. And as if that’s not enough, a gas mask-wearing, knife-wielding maniac decides to skip heading to the cabin where the protagonists are and make a pit stop at the convenience store where I’m working. What’s going on? Why is all this happening to me, a mere side character?! Come for the romance, stay for the horror."

I thought I could finally be free from this foolish love after I’ve died, but… Why is it that when I opened my eyes again, I found myself in someone else’s body?
Even worse, I transmigrated into a novel? And why is my ex-husband here, too? He became the S-Class Esper who was obsessed with the female lead—enough that he would eventually commit treason against the Crown Prince, who was the true male lead.
More than anything else though, why did I suddenly manifest the abilities of a Guide? …Ah, whatever. I died anyway, so that should be the same as a divorce, I guess. * * * “My wife, did you think that I wouldn’t recognize your guiding?” Why do you remember me.
Why are you looking at me like that, not the female lead? With those eyes so full of obsession and madness.
You weren’t originally this kind of man. He approached me at a languid pace, watching closely as I was at a loss for words.
His saunter was slow and elegant, as though he was a lion approaching his prey—even so, he could not hide his thirst and hunger. No, it’s not as if he was even trying to hide it. As he finally arrived in front of me, he raised one hand and held my chin. With his thumb, unceremoniously, he rubbed my lower lip.
At the familiar action, I felt myself shudder. He had always been rather rough whenever he received my guiding.
His delighted expression was slightly distorted. “Ha…” The moment his skin touched mine—the moment I started guiding him—he let out a deep, drawn-out sigh. His hot, thick breath clung to my eyes and lips. I felt a warm hand touch my back, and he soon pulled me close to him forcefully. With my body pressed entirely against his, I couldn’t hide my surprise as I glanced up at him.
Then, when he opened his previously closed lids, his blue eyes looked at me as though he’d been waiting. With his lips so close to the tip of my nose, he turned his head obliquely as he crooned. “I’ve been looking for you for such a long time, Honey.”"

As a result, he was sent to prison, interrogated fiercely, and almost died tragically. Ruan Qing: “……What kind of damned opening is this?” At this time, the system suddenly appeared: “Dear, the surgical system is now bound to you. It not only provides MRI, vaccine development, medical cosmetology, and other modern medical technologies, but it also drops various medical equipment and medicines from time to time!” So Ruan Qing returned to his old profession and started practicing medicine in the Dayan Dynasty. The first trial—testing the water: Huizhou was hit by a pandemic and a vaccine was developed to save thousands of victims. Gradually moving on to his next case: For the deformed child in Liuhe Village, genetic diagnosis technology was used to avert his tragedy. Now the confident third case: the Empress was strangely disfigured and the medical cosmetic treatment helped restore her youthful appearance. After the nth case, Ruan Qing became completely famous in the capital and became the Imperial Physician of the Dayan Dynasty. The Emperor rewarded thousands of taels of gold and countless manors, but he declined them one by one. Every day, he would go back home to farm the fields and ate three meals a day cooked by a certain jealous man. The key point was that not only did this jealous man have great stamina and often attacked, but he also always liked to cling to him desperately, calling him “wifey” in an aggrieved manner if he got scolded even just a little. In this way, the little doctor was tricked into having one baby after another. Looking at the babies crawling all over the floor and their silly and cheerful father, Ruan Qing (shrugged) said: “I can’t help it, my husband is too clingy.” * Xiao Ziheng was the Second Imperial Prince of the Dayan Dynasty, but he was crippled by a doctor of unknown origin. In extreme anger, he sent the man into prison. But who would’ve thought the little doctor would change his ways? Not only did he solve a pile of medical problems for Dayan and helped the people, he was also able to help him surpass the First Imperial Prince, which was a big deal. Xiao Ziheng: “……I think I’m falling in love, what to do?” However, the little doctor was terribly afraid him. He would pitifully try and please him all day long, but the little doctor never came any closer and so Xiao Ziheng couldn’t help but reflect: “Are you telling me that not liking to smile is illegal?” Later, when the little doctor encountered trouble, he finally bared his canine teeth to protect him. Looking at the surprised look on his face, he laughed: “Be good, are you still afraid of me?” The little doctor blushed in embarrassment and was carried back to his home by Xiao Ziheng to get married. He was so favored that if he wanted the stars or the moon, the Prince was willing to pluck them down the sky for him. Xiao Ziheng (with an evil smile): “Can’t be helped, my wifey is too cute.”"

He was still the young master of the Tang family. Despite his delicate and handsome appearance, he had a natural hearing impairment in his right ear, requiring the use of hearing aids for daily life.

Truly, the heavens had eyes, granting him a chance to completely overpower Fu Shizhao and change the fate of the Tang family. -After finishing the milk, Tang Mian directly snatched the little blanket from Fu Shizhao’s body, lifted his little feet, secretly contemplating a plan, and drowsily fell asleep.

Let’s raise the temperature in the nursery a bit more.” “Zhao Zhao seems to really like the young master’s company too, running over to cuddle up with him.” Snatching the milk bottle and small blanket wasn’t enough.

If you did, help me with mine.” High school Tang Mian: “I can’t get up… Could you bring me breakfast when you pick me up?” University Tang Mian: “Sign me in for the 8 AM class and join me for weekend gatherings.” Fu Shizhao, who had been conditioned by these experiences since childhood, obediently accepted it all, making Tang Mian extremely satisfied. Thanks to his interventions, the Tang family flourished, dealing a heavy blow to their adversaries. Until one day, Tang Mian discovered Fu Shizhao’s diary. It was filled with entries about him. “He was so cute when he was little, and he had a pleasant fragrance.” “I love the way he bosses me around.” “I signed up for the same program as him, contacted the school, and we’ll be roommates.” “I want to become his ‘right ear.’” Tang Mian: …"

Would, after his death, hold onto his already stiffened body, gently place the phoenix crown and red wedding robes he never dared dream of onto him, kiss him devoutly over and over again, and even, like they did in their lifetime, sleep side by side through the night. Awakening from a deep slumber, Fu Nian discovers a chance to rectify all the regrets of his previous life. Everything is still within reach. With a cold exterior but a warm heart, a ruthless monarch finds himself entangled with a stunningly beautiful and seemingly insane individual who is devoted and submissive to only one person, while showing no mercy as the commander of a ruthless group of shadow guards. The timeline progresses linearly, with no time-traveling involved; the protagonist’s body remains his own throughout."

“Every fifteenth of the month, the Yin guest arrives. No exceptions. Find other arrangements if late.” On a certain fifteenth of a month, Yin Wushu stood on a black stone by the bridge and shouted at Xie Bai from a distance, “Since you moved to this ghostly place, you haven’t let me in again.” Xie Bai gripped the door, expressionless, “Is that all?” Yin Wushu continued, “After all, I’ve raised you with blood, sweat, and tears for nearly a hundred years.” Xie Bai’s face remained cold, “So what?” Yin Wushu suggested, “Should we go easy on the door?” Without a word, Xie Bai raised his hand and with a loud “bang,” slammed the door shut, causing even the stone bridge to shake.
Yin Wushu: “…” Yin Wushu, dumbfounded and at a loss for words, gazed in disbelief, realizing that his heartfelt plea had been met with an indifferent and powerful rebuke. In this complex and intricate narrative, we witness the tale of two individuals caught in the clutches of their twisted circumstances.

The other, the “Lived too close to that twisted person and couldn’t avoid becoming twisted too” vulnerable and fragile recipient, narratively misleads us with their outward appearance, concealing a deeper fragility within."

One day, Wei Lai was hastily called to attend a dinner. As the last person to enter the private room, she was taken aback to find her ex there. Being a minor character, she wasn’t considered important enough for the host to introduce everyone at the table to her. During the dinner, her ex gave her a toast. “Congrats, I heard you’ve found a new love.” Curious onlookers asked her about the new boyfriend. “Which tycoon from Beijing?” Wei Lai didn’t know of any tycoons from Beijing whatsoever, and she didn’t know how the rumor came to be, so she casually just mentioned the name of a well-known unmarried tycoon she had heard of, “Zhou Sujin.” Everyone at the table: “…….” All eyes turned to the man in the main seat. Confused, Wei Lai also followed their gaze, locking eyes with the man who exuded a mysterious and charismatic aura. Leaning back in his chair casually, noble and indifferent, he looked at her with a cold yet intriguing gaze. Wei Lai wondered if she was really that unlucky. Could this man be a friend of Zhou Sujin? The host of the dinner came back to his senses. Seeing that Zhou Sujin didn’t deny it, he smiled and congratulated him, “No wonder you suddenly came to Jiang City, it turns out you came to see your girlfriend.” Zhou Sujin smiled. He, himself, didn’t even know when he had gotten a girlfriend. The first thing Zhou Sujin said to Wei Lai was, “Since it’s all out in the open now, come sit next to me.” Wei Lai: “…” ML’S POV: On his 30th birthday, he found himself thinking of Wei Lai amid the cheers of his friends urging him to make a wish. Cold-blooded and heartless, that was how others described him. Only Wei Lai had ever called him a good person. It was only when she was using him that her words were so sweet. For the first time in his life, he made a birthday wish for a woman, hoping she would have all her desires fulfilled. One night, the group chat with his childhood friends erupted with multiple mentions @ him: Someone was pretending to be you and wrote a love letter to Wei Lai, but the handwriting doesn’t look like yours. Handwriting came second; nobody believed that the usually aloof Second Young Master of the Zhou family would lower himself like this. Zhou Sujin replied, “No one is pretending. I wrote it.” It was a love letter that he wrote stroke by stroke for Wei Lai. If she wanted to use his power, he was willing to let her borrow it for a lifetime."

It’s hard for you to recover.” “Master, I won’t die, will I?!” Mu Qingqing squeezed the master’s hand with her backhand, and looked anxiously into those weathered eyes. “Don’t worry, the master won’t let you die.” As soon as she finished speaking, she saw a light flashing from the master’s fingertips, and then she pressed it onto her lower abdomen. “Master! What are you doing?!” Mu Qingqing looked at the master dumbfounded. Suddenly she felt her cervix shrinking, a pile of lustful turbid fluid gushing out of her hole, and her body began to feel hot and weak. “My master has opened your Hehuan point for you. Relying on it, you can rely on the man’s s**en to gradually restore your martial arts.” ​ “This is the last resort to save your life.” After saying that, she shook her head and waved her hand to let her leave. “Remember, you must find a very strong man. The thicker the stick and the thicker the s**en, the faster your skills will recover.” The master’s words echoed in the corridor. Although Mu Qingqing was very resistant in her heart, she decided to embark on a journey to find the big stick for the sake of her own life."

Throughout the past six years, she has consistently played a subservient role, enduring the discomfort of receiving cold treatment despite her genuine efforts. She believed that Liu Yueming’s lack of verbal affection could be overcome through wholehearted dedication, hoping to warm her heart in the process. In the sixth year of being together, Yu Kai, having achieved the title of Best Actress, meticulously prepared a key necklace to unlock the icy padlock and officially become Liu Yueming’s girlfriend.

He was a poor imitation, living in the shadow of his brother, a cheap gift sent by his brother to the Emperor as a substitute. Even his chance at the imperial examination had been ruined, and he felt abandoned by the entire world. He was the cannon fodder of a melodramatic love story, whose tragic death served to fulfill others’ romances. Enough was enough.

Following the generic plotline, he was supposed to take the protagonist, who would face a challenging destiny, as his disciple. He would use love and tenderness to influence him, cling to his thigh, and incidentally prevent his descent into darkness. However, the plot took an unexpected twist, and the protagonist still succumbed to darkness. The darkened protagonist personally inflicted harm upon Pei Jing, crippling him, destroying his cultivation, annihilating his sect, and casting him into endless hell. Pei Jing: “Hehe, interesting :)” And so, in the depths of hell, he too succumbed to darkness. Emerging from the Abyss of Ten Thousand Ghosts, the once pristine Immortal in white transformed into a blood-red Asura. He severed the protagonist’s limbs and sealed him in the depths of the sea, thinking it would be the end. However, he didn’t anticipate that it was only the beginning. He was reborn, but in a body that was not his own. After transmigrating into the book, Pei Jing’s first task was to find the protagonist, take him as his disciple, and search and search. And finally, at a certain street corner, he found him… Pei Jing’s heart filled with joy. He bent down and reached out his hand to the protagonist, saying, “Young friend, are you willing to become my disciple?” The protagonist raised his dirty head, looking confused. However, at that moment, another person’s hand reached out and touched Pei Jing’s. That person was dressed in black, with a mysterious and alluring appearance. Smiling, beautiful yet dangerous, he said, “Immortal, what do you think of me?” Pei Jing: “???” And just like that, he ended up taking two disciples at once. It seemed like quite a lucrative development—but wait, wait a minute, is this development a bit unusual?"

She was neither the female lead or the supporting female lead. She did not even have a name in the entire novel. Gu Mingzhu was very happy about it. She was very honest and respectful, so she might even be able to live a peaceful life! However, a blind date banquet caused her to encounter the villainous male supporting character from the novel: the Prince of An, Han Min. When she looked at his face, she instantly only had one thought in her mind: Little brother, I can! ********** Han Min was a typical beautiful, strong, and miserable villain. He was a prince, but he had never been favored. His biological mother was just a dancer and passed away early, and his adoptive mother was a madwoman who likes to mistreat the weak. It was not until he grew up and sided with the Crown Prince that he was living a decent life. But those days did not last long. He nearly lost his legs to save the Crown Prince and his side concubine. From that point on, he became a useless person. Han Min never gained anything in life, and ended up losing in life. Han Min became increasingly gloomy, and thought that since he couldn’t live well, then no one else could either! However, in that same moment, he had a startling realization that he did not lose everything. He still had his face, which could attract a dazzling ‘pearl’(Mingzhu means pearl)! ********** Small Theater One: Gu Mingzhu felt that things keep going wrong. Her husband didn’t seem to love the female lead, and he was not very devoted to the female lead. Does that mean he is going to have a bunch of concubines in the future… Before Gu Mingzhu could finish thinking through her wild thoughts, Han Min leaned over, and his handsome face was all she could see. He smirked and chuckled lightly, “Mingzhu’er, it’s already late, we should go to sleep.” Gu Mingzhu, whose thoughts became all jumbled up, didn’t even know what he was saying when she agreed. Han Min knew that when he did that, it would capture her attention. While he was feeling proud, he also felt a bit scared. He had to ask the imperial physician to make him something to avoid losing his beauty one day. Gu Mingzhu, who knew nothing about this, thought: Oh, my husband is so good looking. I can look at him for the rest of my life! ********** Small Theater Two: Han Min sat on the Dragon Throne and looked down condescendingly at the official who placed third in the exams and was kneeling in the center of the hall. He watched the handsome man’s pale face tremble since he did not know what wrong he had committed. Han Min: “Tsk.” The next day, the official was appointed a position outside of the capital by the Emperor, and it would be more than ten years before he could finally transfer back to the capital. Han Min sat on the Dragon Throne with great satisfaction. However, his expression did not change at all as he examined the immense changes that occurred in the official. Han Min’s attitude was so gracious that the man wept and vowed to die for Da Sheng and Han Min. Han Min continued to watch as the man left. He took out a small mirror from under his chair and murmured: “This is wonderful. I am still the most beautiful man in the world.” CP: Typical Beautiful, Strong, and Miserable Villain X Beauty Loving and Naturally Seductive Pearl"

Not only did a fool ascend the throne, but also a eunuch seized great power. Wu Jing found himself in the shoes of the last imperial son of the Great Zhou, a recently crowned emperor who was perceived as a fool. He watched as people took advantage of his ignorance, serving him a meager meal of vegetables and plain rice. Fists clenched, he grew angry. Outside the palace hall, palace maids gossiped:
“That little emperor is quite handsome.”
“If only he weren’t a fool.”
“The Ninth Thousand Years probably won’t tolerate the restored normal emperor sitting in this position.” Wu Jing felt deflated.
He had to swallow his pride and continue pretending to be a fool. Until one day, as he passed by the imperial garden, he accidentally saw the unpredictable and ruthless Ninth Thousand Years, known for killing without blinking, wearing a crane-patterned court robe. The red sleeves draped gracefully on the ground. The Ninth Thousand Years squatted down, revealing a side profile with a smiling expression, extending a slender hand, feeding… a wild cat! This cat was one of the wild cats in the imperial garden.
The next day, at the same spot, he saw the Ninth Thousand Years feeding a limping stray dog. The third encounter was in the imperial study.
Wu Jing sat stiffly on the grand dragon throne, with a eunuch beneath his feet, a ten-year-old who accidentally spilled tea on the Ninth Thousand Years’ robe, now frantically bowing. Blood streamed down his face. After a moment, someone came to take the little eunuch away, but the man sitting in the chief minister’s chair suddenly spoke in a gentle tone, “Forget it, he’s just a child.” Wu Jing shifted his black eyes.
Ning Qinghong turned his gaze, “Your Majesty, please let me review your lessons during this time.” “Gurgle—”
Wu Jing awkwardly looked at his stomach, a sudden insight striking him. The semi-grown teenager tilted up a pretty little face, his black eyes innocent, “Brother, I’m hungry.” Ning Qinghong narrowed his eyes slightly, picked up a pastry, “Come here.” He fed the little emperor like he was feeding a kitten, coaxing him to finish. Rumors spread that the Ninth Thousand Years suffered from a mental illness.
Sometimes smiling, sometimes cruel and tyrannical. Wu Jing, who regretted hugging this thigh too late, hid in the wardrobe of the sleeping palace, hearing calls from outside. Ning Qinghong, with a cold face, spoke in an oddly soft tone,
“Wu Wu, aren’t you hungry?”"

The Earth, which has come to coexist with such dungeons, has been filled with unknown lifeforms, unknown technology, and skills created by the mana pollution caused by the appearance of dungeons. That’s good. No, it’s not good. The profession of adventurer was born, and each company bought the materials of demons that can be obtained and the items that can be obtained from the treasure chest for a large amount of money, and the world became an era of adventurers… That’s the templates, right? …Well, it didn’t happen.

Of course, that means, anyone dives into the dungeon for no reward. Even if they have the skills, are they willing to risk their life? Of course, no. Then, what do you think will happen? Fortunately, the weapons of the earth worked on the monsters. So, people were able to defeat them with a gun or missile. It’s that easy. …But they appear every day. I’m sure it’s because they don’t dive into the dungeon and thin out monsters on a regular basis. Well, if only a few dungeons appeared in the world, it was still good. But dungeons were everywhere. From dungeons with only weak monsters to dungeons with strong monsters. The army fought with them every day. Using ammunition like hot water and shooting missiles like fireworks.

They were known as Long Aotian. Without a master who imparted their wisdom, loyal little brothers, and diligent errand runners, they would not have survived. To ensure the operation of the small world that was about to collapse, Jian Yuanbai had to play these roles. Jian Yuanbai: That is, as long as Long Aotian can succeed in the end, it will be fine, right? System: …That’s right, but the host must remember to have the male protagonist say Long Aotian’s lines at the right time. In each world, Jian Yuanbai completed his tasks exceptionally well.

In fact, Jian Yuanbai initially wanted to follow the plot honestly, but amidst Long Aotian’s constant “GeGe” claims, he gradually lost himself, filled with passionate dreams night after night.

The system crashed, went crazy, and became utterly furious: That was just a f*cking dream. You’re still pure! Jian Yuanbai looked at the soft and white Long Aotian, with a deep and determined expression, and insisted: No, I’m not pure anymore. Then, he exchanged the muscle-bound, eight-foot-tall cultivation method for another one. It was not that he disliked being strong, but he preferred a gentler spouse. MINI THEATER: In fact, Jian Yuanbai felt quite guilty inside. The novel’s Long Aotian says: Seven times a night, joy every night. After becoming his wife: Fainted three times in one night. Jian Yuanbai blamed himself: I only made my wife faint three times, and there are still four more to go. I am sorry for my wife, but I will try my best. Long Aotian sneered: …Seven times in one night, and you’ll end up without a wife! World One: The poor little chess piece abandoned by the Aristocratic Family Facing his cold-blooded family who kicked him out of the house and wanted to see him struggle to survive, Long Aotian’s eyelashes trembled, and he suppressed shame, saying: “Today’s disgrace, I will repay it a hundred times!” The goal was not achieved, and instead, they watched Long Aotian being vigorously cultivated and adored by the top wealthy Jian family. The extremely doting family member said: …What a tricky way to show off. World Two: The poor little loser whose engagement was broken off Long Aotian’s ears were red, and his wet eyes looked at Jian Yuanbai begging for mercy. Jian Yuanbai: “Say quickly.” Long Aotian: “Thirty years east of the river, thirty years in the west, Mo bullying the poor!” (三十年河东，三十年河西 is a proverb, which means that thirty years ago good Feng Shui was on the east side of the river, but thirty years later it was on the west side of the river. Later, it became a metaphor that world affairs or people’s destiny are always in constant change, and there is no fixed number of rise, fall, honor and disgrace.) Before they could humiliate Long Aotian, they were suppressed by Jian Yuanbai. They vomited blood and fell to the ground. Villains: …Give us our lines back.

Tatsuya Ono (35) had been in another world for half a year.
The first party he joined was a bust. “Old man, go do that.”
“Old man, you’re really useless, huh?” Even after being transported to another world, his days were spent being mocked and treated as an errand boy by the younger party leader. Although the reward money and experience points were supposed to be shared, Tatsuya hardly received any. In such a situation, Tatsuya wondered to himself. (Is this really okay?) Thinking so, Tatsuya decided to leave the party and become a freelancer. “You, being useless as you are, will still be useless no matter where you go. No one would entrust you with jobs, old man.” That’s what the leader said to him, but once Tatsuya started working alone, he began to grow remarkably. In fact, this unimpressive “old man” (Tatsuya Ono) was a character who, if nurtured, turned out to be surprisingly strong, something you might see in a game. Eventually, Tatsuya started receiving enough job offers to be selective, and he rose to become a world-famous freelance adventurer. When Tatsuya did jobs with “Japanese quality,” the bad guys around the clients somehow ended up destroying themselves, and a spiral of gratitude towards Tatsuya began to form. Despite just doing the jobs he wanted in a laid-back manner, Tatsuya somehow started to be treated like a hero. And then, good people began to gather around Tatsuya, and good things started happening to him, while the leader somehow ended up losing everything on his own. “I’m just working in a chill and fun way, you know?”"

This is a close-quarters holographic reality game with a focus on cold weapons such as swords, spears, guns, bows, and other melee weapons. The charm of close combat, the interplay of flashing blades and shadows, the brutal battle where only one survives out of a hundred, captivate players and make the major world esports tournaments thrive. Chen Xingran, a weapon master from an ancient martial arts family, wakes up from slumber and finds himself in a strange world, becoming an ordinary student at the Capital Esports Academy, endlessly worrying about how to reach Silver rank. As he looks at the familiar Tang Sword, broadsword, silver spear, dagger, long whip, and more in the game… Chen Xingran falls into contemplation. “I’m familiar with this.” Thus, in “Destiny,” a formidable specialist in weapons emerges. His swordsmanship is sharp and elusive, his heavy sword has no edge, his gun moves like a dragon, and his dagger is as agile as a serpent… No matter how challenging the weapon is, it becomes a magnificent and dangerous performance in his hands. “A Tang Sword is not used like this.” “Protecting teammates? Not necessary.” “Isn’t it enough to eliminate all the enemies?” … In the world of “Destiny,” a legend begins to spread about a fearsome demon king. It is said that every professional player who faces him in combat meets a tragic end… However, the good news is that this demon king seems incapable of using ranged weapons? His archery skills are astonishing. Even with a rapid-firing crossbow, he can’t hit a single shot, earning him the title of the “Master of Human Outline Drawing.” Yang Yunchen, the former champion of the FPS World Championship and hailed as the number one marksman, says this while watching the young man who effortlessly takes on three opponents with a Tang Sword. “Why need ranged weapons when I’m here?” The blushing young man, finished with the fight and sharpening his sword, chases after him and slashes three blocks. PS: 1. This is a fictional holographic close-quarters battle royale game with many imaginative elements. You don’t need to have played the game to enjoy the story. 2. Game skills and settings are inspired by games like “Eternal Punishment,” “Apex Legends,” “Overwatch,” and others. 3. The weapon master is invincible in close combat but terrible at using guns, while the archer never misses a shot. They pretend to be weak and rely on their spouse, the cunning world champion, to save them. 4. This story doesn’t follow the typical trope of the protagonist being overwhelmingly strong. There may be initial setbacks, but later on, the characters reach their full potential and dominate the game, creating various highlights. Please avoid making assumptions about the author and enjoy the story and comments harmoniously. Thank you. Content tags: Strong-Strong, Time Travel, Online Games, Gratifying Story Search Keywords: Protagonist: Chen Xingran | Supporting Role: Yang Yunchen | Others: One-sentence summary: A close-quarters weapon-based martial arts battle royale game. Concept: Promoting traditional culture, showcasing the charm of blades and shadows in the martial arts world. Highly recommended work: Chen Xingran, a weapon master from an ancient martial arts family, encounters a car accident and wakes up in a new world where the esports industry is highly developed. He becomes a freshman at an esports academy. In this world, a holographic battle royale game called “Destiny” featuring cold weapons has taken the world by storm. As he looks at the familiar Tang Sword, dagger, longsword, broadsword, and more in the game, Chen Xingran falls into contemplation. Thus, in “Destiny,” a formidable melee demon king who is proficient in all weapons quietly emerges and becomes a terrifying presence in the professional gaming scene. This story flows smoothly and naturally, with vivid and distinct character portrayals. The depiction of battle scenes is delicate and visually engaging, weaving together flashes of blades and shadows, tactical confrontations full of deceit, and the dangerous yet magnificent world of close-quarters weapon combat. With vivid storytelling, it paints a blazing legend in the realm of eSports. TN: Title: The phrase “磨刀不误砍菜弓[电竞]” in Chinese is an idiomatic expression commonly used in the context of eSports. It translates to “Sharpening the knife doesn’t delay the cutting of vegetables with the bow [eSports].” This phrase is often used to emphasize the importance of preparation and practice in esports. It means that even though it is essential to hone your skills and improve your strategies, it should not hinder you from taking immediate action and engaging in competitive gaming. Just like sharpening a knife is necessary for efficient cutting, training and preparation are crucial in esports, but they should not become an excuse for procrastination or hesitation. It highlights the balance between preparation and execution in the world of competitive gaming."

And the young Hercule is forced to take over this empire! “Eeh!? I can’t run away!?” “You can’t.” Thus, the 12 years old Hercule ascends to the throne. Using the knowledge from his previous life, Hercule struggles to rebuild the empire… reforming the tax system, revolutionizing the industry, reorganizing the public finances, rebuilding the administration and reforming the military system. This will later be known as the story of the young emperor who restored the Lemurian empire, which would later carve it’s name in history as the great monarch of the three continents, the “Divine Light Emperor” Hercule the First."

Option 3: The legendary school grass so indifferent that it’s rumored he lacks any s*xual desire. Clarifications: Initially, the Shou will have the tendencies of many liking him due to early investments, but later, he is devoted to one person and values monogamy. From the beginning of the story, the Gong has already developed an interest in the Shou, not necessarily an unreasoning deep love. As the story progresses, the reasons why the Gong is attracted to the Shou will be revealed.

The author is unaware of specific reader preferences, and if there are issues, they will be addressed as needed. The ABO system is just a form of gender or s*xual attraction.

With tears in his parents eyes, they sent him to Chu Wang Mansion to marry to drive away the evil spirits for the ailing young master of the Chu family. On that day, Chu Hechao, the second son of the Chu Wang Mansion, returned hurriedly from the battlefield, still wearing his armor. Without even taking it off, he performed the ceremonial rites on behalf of his brother and paid respects to the heavens and earth alongside Yuan Li. Yuan Li caught a whiff of the scent of blood and dust on Chu Hechao’s body, and his heart skipped a beat. He understood that this was a dangerous individual. That night, Chu Hechao drank a cup of ceremonial wine with Yuan Li on behalf of his brother. Yuan Li smiled gently and said, “General, please.” As he held the wine cup, his fingers were as slender as jade, and his handsome face was adorned with long, fluttering eyelashes. Chu Hechao stared at him for a while, his expression a smile but not a smile, before raising his hand and downing the wine in one gulp. Half a month later, the young master of the Chu Wang Mansion passed away, and Chu Hechao abducted Yuan Li, taking him on a horse and heading straight for the frontier. *** Yuan Li continued to exert his efforts on the ancient battlefield. He cultivated crops, raised cattle and sheep, cleared roads, and established medical facilities. Busy day in and day out, he fed the mighty army and comforted the wounded soldiers, turning the military camp into a better place. The generals treated him as if they were meeting their parents who provided them with food and clothing. The only man who had brought him here wore a perpetual scowl, suppressing his anger. “I am the one you married, the one who drank the ceremonial wine with you, and also the one who shared the wedding chamber with you. Shouldn’t you be looking at me?”"

He originally thought he had nothing to do with the story plot and treated it as getting the opportunity to experience the life of a cultivator. However, when he was 12 years old, because the sect couldn’t gather 4 female cultivators to participate in the Immortal Sects’ Unique (Mah) Skills (Jong) Competition for Women, he was forced into women’s clothing by his DaShijie and taken to the WanXian Pavilion to fill the numbers. In the back mountains of WanXian Pavilion, he met the still young Long AoTian. The Proud Dragon Son of Heaven said he had fallen in love with “her” at first sight. Yu QingTang: “……” He put on a fake smile and said: “Haha, I am still young. Come propose in the future if you’re capable.” The Proud Dragon Son of Heaven snapped a peach blossom branch and handed it to him. Eyes bright and hopeful with a shimmering light, and the mannerism of an innocent young boy, he said with reddened ears: “It’s a deal!” Yu QingTang was almost blinded by this harmless and benign face before recalling how in the book, this person had peach blossoms like the flowing water, childhood sweethearts all over the world, and red and white roses fighting to the death over him. Instantly his heart calmed like still water. Rejecting all feelings and relations, he replied insincerely: “Of course of course.” …… Seven years later, the Proud Dragon Son of Heaven, who grew up to be a humanoid typhoon, came for a visit. Yu QingTang’s cheap Master: “Oh Tang! He went to the Seven Swords Sect before and beat them until there’s only two swords left! This Master is already old and can no longer handle such a youthful warrior!” Da-Shijie: “Xiao-Shidi, don’t panic. I have a treasure that can solve this problem!” She took out the Beauty Pavilion’s newest and most fashionable outfit for female cultivators. Yu QingTang: “…… Get lost!” …… To save the declining sect, Yu QingTang decided to debut as a female cultivation idol…… like hell. Enduring the humiliation in silence, he changed into women’s clothes and decided to tactfully reject Long AoTian according to his Shijie’s instructions. As soon as he left the sect’s gates, he saw the young man leaning against a long spear, stepping on the head of a ferocious beast that had been harassing the sect for so many months it almost made his Master activate the mountain’s great defense wards. Eyes shining bright like stars, the young man hastily wiped away the blood on his hands and called to him: “XianZi!” “The Qing Province’s Golden Core Competition is summoning all of the world’s heroes. I… I want to invite XianZi to travel there together with me. I don’t know if XianZi can, uhh……” It seemed as if he rarely said such genteel and cultured words. Stumbling several times in one sentence, he glanced up at Yu QingTang with a red flushed face, pure and innocent. Yu QingTang looked cautiously at the censored corpse of the ferocious beast beneath his foot and suspected this might be his state of death after he opens his mouth: “……” —Shijie, even though the script you wrote to snap off this peach blossom was very cool, I really don’t have the damn guts QAQ!

Huh, I have reincarnated into a fantasy world, haven’t I? Moreover, it was the romance-fantasy girl game that had the reputation of being bloody, 『Liber Monstrorum ~Phantom Beasts and the Winter Princess~』 The face reflected in the mirror was that of the villainess character of that game. After repeatedly harassing many characters, including the heroine, she would die without exception, signaling the beginning of an event called the bizarre incident. She was a villain who deserved to get the consequences! —I absolutely don’t want a destiny like that, though? No, since I have remembered the memory of my previous life, I will make sure that kind of thing does not happen. In my previous life, I was harassed immensely by an irrationally angry yandere man who thought I was in love with him. My cause of death, too, was from being stabbed by another yandere man who I only had talked with a few times… Now that I have become the haughty villainess Erica, I shouldn’t encounter more misunderstandings like with the previous life’s yandere men anymore, right…? In that case, it will be fine as long as I deal with the death flags that I may have raised myself. All right! First of all, before the bizarre incident begins at the Magic Academy, I will strike down the death flags accordingly!! —Or so I thought, but it seems that I am about to die.

It would have been fine if he was just an unimportant side character, but according to the plot of the original book, Xie Yunming would only focus on breaking the life-and-death contract and send him off to the west. In order to avoid this death flag, Chu Yan decided to work hard to restore his negative favorability points with Xie Yunming to ±0. For example, he would take the initiative to find the ancient scroll that allowed them to undo the life-and-death contract so that they could peacefully split— Shit!? Chu Yan watched helplessly as Xie Yunming burned up the ancient scroll with spiritual flames until there wasn’t even ashes left. In the dim light, the man’s face was full of smiles and his words were gentle, “What are you thinking, shidi? If I die, you shall be buried with me.” Chu Yan: ??? Is something wrong with you?! — Rumor has it that after Xie Yunming, the head disciple of the Sword Sect, returned from his travels, he brought with him a shidi with extremely poor talent and a weak and sickly body. This shidi had a peerless appearance as well as a gentle and kind temper. If it weren’t for his body that almost guaranteed he would die young, the number of people that would come to propose marriage would have probably smashed the Mountain Gate of the Sword Sect to the ground. Everyone guessed that he wouldn’t live longer than a few years, and they lamented that such a proud son of Heaven like Xie Yunming had become cultivation partners with this shidi. Maybe he was looking forward to becoming a widower. Unexpectedly, after hundreds of years, there were actually two sword cultivators from the Sword Sect who passed their tribulations and ascended at the same time. One was Xie Yunming, the proud son of Heaven, and the other was Chu Yan, his shidi who died young. Chu Yan: Thank you for bringing me. We have now ascended and share the same life as Heaven and Earth. Xie Yunming: Share the same life as Heaven and Earth? Chu Yan: No, no, share it with you."

The view was already red, so only Kim San’s white face could be seen properly. The broken reason was trampled by instinct and made a harsh sound without a chance to be slowed. All that was left was red-flashing anger. Towards Kim San who keeps trying to run away from him. “I’ve been letting you off the hook, but you keep on pushing me.” “Uh, Ugh.” He pushed Kim San down. An unpleasantness impulsed him when a suppressed groan burst out due to rough hand movements. “I didn’t know you’d want to take charge of another Esper.” “Well, that’s not it……, Ugh!” A few gestures tore off the clothes that Kim San was wearing. He pushed down Kim San, who was struggling. Kim San’s face, which was crushed as if it were buried, is now embarrassed and confused. If you leave things like this, this painful anger will not die down. “I’ll make it impossible for you to be a guide.”"
