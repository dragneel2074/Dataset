After going bankrupt, with nothing left in his hands, Lathel died at the age of 50. After his death, a god offered him a chance to go to another world and help the male protagonists.
His mission was to solve the problems surrounding the heroines so that the male protagonists could easily get along with them.
To be more precise, his job was similar to that of a chef. He would Process the ingredients and cook a sumptuous feast, while the male protagonists just needed to sit at the table and enjoy it.
After completing his mission, he was threatened by a stranger. In the face of this threat Lathel just smiled and decided to commit suicide.
After he died, those heroines also dropped their facade and revealed their true nature.
Lathel once again met the god who helped him. This time, the god allowed him to choose the world he wanted to go to as a gift for completing his task.
He then chose a Fantasy world, a place most men dreamt of.
However, the Fantasy world had too many people to choose from, moreover the number of main character and antagonist slots were all full.
In the end, Lathel accepted to take on the role of an extremely weak supporting character to go to the Fantasy world.
However, this time he didn't need to work or help the main character. He just needed to not affect the main character's development.
Lathel: “Hm... as long as it doesn't affect the main character... then... Can I make a harem?”
God: “Of course.”
Lathel: “Hm... so... I just need to avoid the main character's woman.”
God: “That's right. You just need to try to survive in that world. Ah! I will give you a system that will help you have a good life in that world. I Hope you enjoy this new life.”
Lathel: “Um! So my harem will consist of lackluster women, it seems like a peaceful life is waiting for me.”
God: “Hm... not really...”

The first immersive virtual MMORPG, The Legend Enigma Online, has conquered the game market! There's not even one person who hasn't heard or seen this game's beautiful and vast magical world overflowing with monsters.

Everyone wanted to play this game and be a part of history!

Conjuring magic, wielding enormous swords, and even flying across the skies are possible in this game! Guns, arrows? Those are boring compared to this!

Jake, however, was compelled to think differently.

When the archery became abandoned and forgotten, he took this class and swore to prove others wrong, all because he likes to go against the mainstream!

With the bow in his hand, Jake finds passion, talent, and excitement in archery, but will that be enough against the challenges the world keeps for him?

It's not only the players that find archery weaker than magic. After the dawn of mana, which happened over two hundred years ago, even NPCs prefer magic over bows. 

While the other classes have been developed so much by NPCs that players have many luxuries to pick from, the archery is now a mere shadow of its past.

That's only the tip of the iceberg of the future Supreme Archer's difficulties!

""No matter whatever it is and how long it takes, I'll take everything on and get my archery to the top! The archery where I'm the master and artisan of my bows and arrows, the tailor of my equipment, and pioneer of my own skills!""

Hard work, talent, bitter defeats, and uproarious victories–none of it is foreign to Jake!",https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/28434393308567905?imageMogr2/thumbnail/150&imageId=1710368864854

[Talent: Future Seer]

Mediocre: This was a thing in the world that nobody wanted to be, not a thing in this world!

""Fuck the world I just want to live a normal life for once.""

Aur was tired from being called as the strongest fighter in the world, died at the hands of his own brother and reincarnated into the Magic World, a world ruled by the Wizard's.

Now, he decided to embrace mediocrity and enjoy his life rather than living in fear every day of dying with a system at hand—the ""muscle system,"" doing daily quests to become stronger with the talent of a future seer.

....

""Aren't you supposed to be an ordinary wizard. How are you so strong?""

The man muttered as the very earth crumble and the mountains behind him split with the sheer pressure of the giant fist that was descending on him.

There was no suprise the man was crushed into meat paste.

Aur looked at the distant sun.

""Throughout Heaven and Earth, I have the strongest muscle,"" Aur proclaimed as he had trained his body to the limits, breaking the very reality into pieces reaching boundaries that defied the common sense of individuals.

All while being a mediocre mage in the surface.

A handsome male asked the void but received no answer, his face filled with shock as he awoke from sleep in a hospital bed; the date told him it was just seven days before he was destined to die.

He woke up in a white world, and met a divine being that allowed him to be reborn in a new world. It seemed to be the normal thing now. 

However, through a misunderstanding, the Divine being sent him into the body of a character with the same name in an apocalyptic novel called Surviving the Apocalypse with My S Rank Wives.

A novel about the MC Chu Feng collecting beauties and beating the undead with his amazing skills as a former soldier king...

The problem was Seth didn't get reborn as Chu Feng... but a small, pathetic side villain with the same name.

Someone who would die on the day the apocalypse started!

He was given a lifeline! 

His [Apocalypse System] was designed to make him into a Supreme Villain that added an RPG Level up system for Seth and anyone who becomes his ally and many other features.

The Villain's Side Of the Story In The New Plot,Fri123,Fantasy,"# ADVENTURE, # ROMANCE, # ACTION, # SYSTEM, # MAGIC, # MYSTERY, # ANTIHERO","I find myself in an unexpected role - the villain. It's a realization that dawns upon me, and I must admit, I never saw myself as the hero. Deep down, I carried a sense of responsibility for the resentment and animosity people harboured towards me. Perhaps I truly wasn't as kind or benevolent as the protagonist.

Yet, I can't fully embrace the label of a villain. It perplexes me to awaken one day and comprehend that everyone else, including those I was prepared to protect at the cost of my own life, perceives me as such.

To add to the weight of this revelation, fate has bestowed upon me an immense burden—the task of saving humanity itself. The irony is not lost on me. As a villain, it is not my duty to preserve the world. However, to whom should I entrust this responsibility? Should I leave it to the protagonist, whose primary pursuit seems to be amassing a personal harem under the guise of luring beauty? The very hero who possessed the most potent cheat codes yet failed to fulfil his duty in the end. This same hero seeks to safeguard our enemies simply because they currently reside in a state of peace.

Ah, the mere thought of that hypocrite, convincing himself that he desires control to protect the innocent, ignites a fire within me.

Sighing deeply, I come to a resolution. Yes, I will undertake the task of saving this chaotic world, but I will do it on my terms. Those who dare cross my path shall soon comprehend why the world itself deems me a villain.

[This revised novel, a departure from my debut ""The Villain Side of the Novel,"" introduces an alternate plotline where Fray persists in the struggle for the throne.

Dark as pitch-black, and the land was damped with silence. Only the cold breeze whispered amidst the calm and soundless skies. Though below it was a small settlement burning in crimson flames. Decimated beyond relief with rubbles everywhere.

Cold corpses were strewn throughout the settlement, with some bodies ripped apart into bloodied pieces. Puddles of velvet blood formed, and chunks of flesh dangled along the concrete walls in gory ways. It was a horrifying sight, but this was the reality in the world of Terra. 

Near the building where the former leader of the settlement resided was a young man leaning on the concrete wall. There were no emotions on his face as he held a revolver tightly under his fingers. His name was Duke Shepherd. Before the end, he was but a humble college student. 

Duke was the only remaining survivor in the small settlement after it was overrun by an aberrant flood. He initially wanted to rest eternally using the revolver when he gazed upon what was left. But he couldn't find the strength to do so. Despite the unending tragedies and suffering...

He wanted to live.

Malacai is a result of an experiment. His parents created him from an embryo in the lab, their goal being to create a superhuman.

They put him in an orphanage. Malacai hated his parents because of this; he swore REVENGE!!!

Time passed, and he turned seventeen. His life was almost hell now. He was bullied every day. 

The reason? It was because he was very handsome, but his body was so frail. If others could sprint ten laps, then one lap was enough to make him feel tired; 2 laps and he would collapse.

Then, one day, he gets beaten up very badly. As he lay down, feeling his life was leaving him, a black crow landed in front of him.

To be clear, yuri means a romantic/physical relationship between two women, meaning no two women will ever have sexual interactions with each other without the MC present. That said, Elora enjoys serving women up to him on a platter, and watching him have sex with them. She enjoys dominating, observing. and playing with the other women in the MC's harem together with him, and thus will occasionally join him in such a way.

Killing God: Wrath of the First Nephilim KG,TheCulture,Fantasy,"# ACTION, # ADVENTURE, # R18, # MAGIC, # WEAKTOSTRONG, # MYSTERY, # VILLAIN, # TRAGEDY, # ANTIHERO","Luke's serene existence in a remote village on the fringes of the Nexaria Empire is abruptly shattered when demonic beasts assail his home, leaving devastation in their wake. Escaping the onslaught, he tragically witnesses the annihilation of his family, leaving him alone in a world marred by chaos.

Captured by the empire's forces instead of receiving the refuge he sought, Luke becomes a subject of their experimental machinations, subjected to a fusion of demonic and angelic genetic alterations. Considered a failed venture, he was cast aside, left to die by the very power that was meant to save him.

Fate, however, had different plans for Luke. The experiment turned out to be a success, creating the first Nephilim whose wraith will be unleashed on the Nexaria empire— a mechanical empire fueled by science and technology, which was currently at war with the Arcanoria empire, a realm steeped in magical prowess and ancient mysticism.

Unbeknownst to both empires, the supreme being, God, has descended into madness—a harrowing omen signaling the imminent demise of the universe itself. In a shocking revelation, it becomes clear that the salvation of existence hinges upon the unthinkable: Killing God.

Luke, now a product of both angelic and demonic forces, finds himself at the center of an unfathomable prophecy—a prophecy dictating that only through the death of a mad god can balance be restored to the cosmos. Luke realizes that his destiny is intertwined with the cosmic fate of all existence.

Blade and Miracle BaM,Innovation_Inu,Fantasy,"# ACTION, # ADVENTURE, # MAGIC, # WEAKTOSTRONG, # DARK, # SLICEOFLIFE, # VILLAIN, # GENIUS, # BETRAYAL, # ACADEMY","A false prophecy, a conspicuous birth, a sinister ritual and a wholehearted sacrifice. These were the elements that set the Cosmic Gears in motion of this world. It all relied on the variables, Lucien Alaric and Mikaela Howell. 
Having had a warm childhood was something they were always proud of, at least until they unveiled the illusion of this false happiness. Their moment of joy was apparently measured and limited. 

“The truth will be revealed to you when you awaken...
Believe nothing but what you have witnessed and judged yourselves as the truth...
Your enemies are closer than you think... 
Trust no one!” 
This were the words the children were left with. Their parents' dying words.

Not words for children to live with, right?

Clip sneak peek~!
""What do you feel?"" she asked.
""Nothing..?"" Mikaela responded, holding his sword tight at hand. In truth, to him, it was no different than cutting down a training puppets head. A tedious endeavor.
""Good, you should spare no feeling to enemies, my child,"" a clear serene voice sounded, like the sweet whisper of the devil. 
In the air was the fishy rustic iron smell, the scent of human blood. Not just a splash of it but a mass graveyard pool of it. The heavy smell of death.
Mikaela stood in the middle of this with calm eyes. The killing intent in his eyes seemed to have become deeper and richer. 

Lucien is born a mage while Mikaela is born a martial artist. They have distinctly opposing personalities and would rather stay away from each other, but destiny has other plans. They have to unite in the face of the upcoming trials of fate. One loss, spells death to both of them! No compromise!
The sacrifice made to protect them drives them to face each day while vengeance motivates them to grow stronger. What kind of future shall they pave in the veil of uncertainty and hidden truth?
While Lucien and Mikaela walk different paths, they ultimately have the same destination.
The Apex!

VRMMORPG: Rebirth of the Strongest Necromancer rsn,AstridStorm,Games,"# ACTION, # SYSTEM, # COMEDY, # MAGIC, # MYSTERY, # KINGDOMBUILDING, # LEVELUP, # VIDEOGAME, # EVOLUTION","David was a man who had been wrongly accused of his friend’s murder. A man who had seen his loved ones get killed in front of him because he was not strong enough. A man who had been given another chance to redo his life by the Angel Seraphiel.

In a world where the popular online game ‘Orion’ would come to life, people would soon realise that this game had been created to smoothly transition Earth to the Ascended Plane, the part of the Universe where different races fought against each other for survival. David had to rise to the peak of his class and create a Kingdom strong enough to fend off the invaders who coveted Earth for themselves.

This time… David had chosen to become a mage and stumbled upon a Mythical class, The Necromancer. He could now store the souls of the monsters he had defeated and create a legion of skeletons of his own.

From summoning skeletons to healing, there was nothing the Necromancer could not do.

However, what David did not know was that the class carried secrets of its own, which would plunge his entire world into darkness.

The Queen of Rifts Rift Queen,daygon_yuuki,Fantasy,"# YURI, # HAREM, # R18, # ACTION, # ROMANCE, # REINCARNATION, # SYSTEM, # MAGIC, # OVERPOWERED, # VILLAIN","Lea was a doll created by humans, the only survivor of a super-secret project, and the only one with the power of the mysterious rifts. It robbed her of dreams, emotions, and also her death.

In the year 2050, the first intergalactic gate opened. Humans saw it as a ray of hope and tried to uncover its secrets. Fifty years later, the same research opened a rift in space, causing monsters to pour out of the splits and attack humanity.

An apocalypse occurred as a result of this, throwing the world into chaos. Humans gained new powers but also lost control easily. 

These special humans were called 'Sentinels'. The only way to get a Sentinel under control was through inhibitors or 'Guides'. But the fragile Guides could not survive for long and died early on.

In response, humanity developed advanced technology to fight against these rifts and regain their lost planet. When the world was at its most desperate, an orphan of unknown origins was chosen to become a soldier to protect them all.

However, the project was closed just when it reached its completion stages and the world lost it's most powerful guide.

Two hundred years later, humanity was still at war with the ‘rift’ trying to live and reclaim their lost planet. And their only hope was the academy they established to train their future generations.

Lea, unable to die or uncover the secrets of her birth, decided to join the academy and fight for her future. But letting go of the past would soon become a problem, especially with the powers of the rift clashing with her humanity.

Having no human morals or limiters, Lea's only goal is to find herself.

""And to you guys too"" I mumbled in annoyance as my eyes landed on men. 
""Hey, can't you just remove men, except for me, from my world?"" I asked _Eshwar_.
(*_Eshwar_ choks on the drink he was drinking and glances away*)
""Tsk, useless!"" I cursed at him and glanced away, ignoring his menacing glare, that spoke volumes on his urge to erase me out of existence.
""Him and I have spoken and we have come to an agreement on him telling you guys my opus, and heh, I will, of course, be the main focus, so ladies~~ You'll be seeing me soon~"" I spoke to the ladies gazing up at me, while I continued to ignore the men in the crowd.
Glancing to the side, my eyes fell on the men, who flinched at the ominous foreboding feeling that abruptly chruned their stomach, ""You better keep your ladies safe...... since they'll be mine soon~~"" I said with a smile that made men shudder while charming the women at the same time. 
My gaze swept over the crowd beneath, ""Since the world I am to transmigrate into is overwhelmingly futuristic, there are many things to adventure about, so we have decided on, not dwelling too much on politics and other shit, but instead focus only on women and me~"" I stated with an enchanting grin.

""Oi, tell them the truth!!"" _Eshwar_'s voice yelled at, from a distance.....
""No wait, isn't he right? But a bit of politics should be good....."" _Eshqar_'s mumbled whispers trickled my sensitive ears, but I didn't like the words that left his mouth. 
""Oi, we discussed not to include politics and shit like tha-"" But it was already too late..... _Eshwar_'s pen wielding hand flitted across the plot filled sheets, as a subtle exclamation escaped his mouth, and at that, I could instantly tell that he was up to no good!
""Oi-""
""With a bit of politics!"" He yelled from a distance, as a ghastly silence descended upon me and the crowd gazing up at me, while the men grinned mockingly and women tilted their heads to the side in such cuteness that I almost forgot the plight at hand. 
Afterall, when I narrated my opus, I stated repeatedly that I don't like politics!
""You added politics?"" I asked with a forced smile.
""Mhm"" _Eshwar_ nodded his head innocently. 
"".....politics?""
""Yeah""

In the far future, the galactic human civilization has entered the Age of Mechs. The countless lesser powers of humanity have come to adopt mechs as their main weapons of war.

Only a small number of humans have the right genetic aptitude to pilot these destructive war machines the size of buildings.

Born to a military family in the edge of the galaxy, Ves Larkinson is one of the many people who lacks the talent to earn glory in battle. Instead, he became a mech designer. Helped by his missing father, Ves has obtained the mysterious Mech Designer System that can help him rise in the galaxy and beyond.

His mechs based on the principles of life quickly allows him to rise to prominence. Powerful and highly compatible with mech pilots, his products have the potential to take the market by storm. However, success does not come easily, and countless challenges bar his ability to sell his mechs to a market eager for innovation!

With the sins of the human race in the galactic arena slowly catching up, Ves must navigate the perils of the ultra-competitive mech market and maintain control over his growing organization of misfits.

This is the golden age of mechs. This is the golden age of humanity. The question is, will it last?

""Any challenge can be overcome as long as I design the right mech!""

Just a warning. Volume 1 sets the atmosphere in a Earth slowly degenerating into chaos and can be considered as a big prologue. It is slow and not as rewarding for the readers than mainstream stories on this website. If you can push through it will be worth it. For some real action you need to wait chap 27.

It decides what is right and what is wrong. To act against it is to sin, to act according to it is to be blessed by its graces.

The world of cultivation is difficult, an unchanging principle. Yet there are those who are cherished by the Heavens, cuddled into rising above all and everyone else. How can this be? Why must this be?

What is moral and just? What is evil and immoral?! 

WHY DOES IT GET TO DECIDE?!

So we, the Sinners, we act against the Heavenly Daos, grasp our own fates in hopes of truly overturning them.

This is a Journey of a young boy born Blessed, but turned Sinner.

The greatest sinner of them all.

After years of intense conflicts between his guild, Hellscape, and the guild of his former infidel lover, Darkrow, things came to a head when Draco conquered all. 

Now, nothing stood in his way of total conquest within the highly acclaimed second world of mankind, as he intended to fortify his new empire.
 
Unfortunately, a timely assassination sent him back into the wheel of time for reincarnation, but not even the Gods gave him peace of death. 

Thrust into the past, Draco realized he'd been given a second chance at life to start from scratch, with all the knowledge of over fifteen years of almost absolute power in Boundless.

Now, his path to glory will be far shorter and filled with more bloodshed than Hades could handle.

Eager to obtain that marvelous weapon for their own nefarious purposes, powerful politicians send their teams after him, hoping to capture and analyze the rod. Konrad was chased from one corner of the world to another and ultimately cornered. But in a fit of fury, he chose to destroy what they worked so hard to obtain!

“Screw your ten thousand ancestors! Only I can wield the golden rod! Since you want it so badly, then fetch its remains!”

He howled as he aimed a gun at the golden rod. But suddenly, the sky darkened, and purple lightning struck him from above.

“Fool! This is a national treasure! Who gave you the right to harm it?”

The Happiness God roared in indignation while sending Konrad into reincarnation. 

“This time put the treasure to better use. Complete all the quests, and I might even let you enjoy the sweet fruits of paradise!”

“God, I won’t disappoint you!” 

Happiness God even gave him a tailor-made system. But there was one problem, he was reborn in the body of a half-incubus eunuch caned to death for offending the emperor’s favorite consort!

Notes:

Side Stories in ""My Cute (Yandere) Disciples' Side Stories""

If you're here for the R18 tag expecting adult scenes, know that this was a decision I made quite late into writing this so the scenes only come up very late into the story.

One or more of the disciples may or may not have a tragic (depending on personal opinions) backstory that may or may not offend/disturb some readers (depending on your personal opinions/mental fortitude/openmindedness/morality/sexual orientation/real world knowledge/political agendas/reaction if someone gave you lemons/view on whether the Earth is flat or round, which I personally think it's neither and is actually a donut nom nom nom) which may or may not affect the rest of the story significantly. Consider yourself sufficiently warned.

History was written by the victors, they said. If so, how about the history of Earth, where we are living in now?

Two millennia ago, a young boy named Emery met his tragic fate. During his last breath, he was taken and accepted into the most prestigious school of magic in the Universe.

“You are among the chosen few from thousands of human worlds. Whether you take hold of this opportunity or not, it is up to you. You are at Magus Academy, the peak of humanity's ingenuity. Magic, science, and might are all available to those who seek them.""

[Scan complete - Quadruple affinity. Water, Earth, Plant, and Darkness.]

""A quadruple acolyte! Only one in tens of thousand acolytes have this!"" 

So began Emery’s journey together with his 4 friends from the furthest corner of Earth. 

Each year they returned to Earth to grow, get revenge, save the princess, conquer the world, and become Earth's Greatest Magus.

Their names are still written in our history books until today.

Authors Note:

I have always been fascinated by writing fantasy relating to historical facts. In this story, you will find characters inspired by real-world myth and legend. The universe I created hopefully will make the reader's imagination excited and logically plausible. I hope you enjoy it.

Author own Review after writing 800 chapters

It’s a Slow Burn, as slow as the whole volume 1 maybe depressing to read. The MC is still a little boy and he do mistakes. But if you could pass the second volume you will see how this story could stay in the webnovel top 20 trending for two years.
Here are some of the things you will find here
MC: Heroic, weak to strong, classic good guy in a cruel world. Fortunately, you will see he has many good friends who could fill up his weaknesses.
World: Imagine Harry Potter combine with StarWars
System: It is a Magic story but with a System to easily follow. There is also cultivation
Harem: No, there are many female characters. But I enjoy romance first. So even if there will be more than one love interest it will be deep.

Other: There is deep research on science and history throughout the novel. Hope you will give this a try and be surprised",https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/18131953005387705?imageMogr2/thumbnail/150&imageId=1698153371873

People were blown away by the game’s hyper-realistic features and endless adventures. Everyone from small companies to big corporations and governments scrambled to get a foothold on this mysterious video game.

But what they didn't know was that this game was actually a tutorial for the upcoming apocalypse that was about to hit the planet! The game was a precursor to the Earth's first evolution, where mana was going to be unleashed into the real world!

Liam, a high school student who had faced numerous setbacks in his life, turned to 'Evolution Online' in the hope of changing his fate, but instead, he got trapped in the game's twisted world, and things went from bad to worse.

When the apocalypse finally arrived, Liam barely managed to escape, but his situation didn't improve. Along with millions of others, he died a miserable death, unable to fight back and filled with regret.

However, Liam's story didn't end there. He found himself inexplicably transported back in time before everything started! 

Armed with the knowledge of what was to come, Liam was determined to become the strongest and most powerful player, unleashing destruction upon the world that had ruined him before! This time, things were going to be different!

Did I just get reincarnated in my own novel? Is this where I reincarnate in a novel and become the protagonist? No. Sadly it's not that kind of novel, as I reincarnated as a mob. The world doesn't revolve around me. The girls don't come flocking towards me. The cheat items don't come to me. ""Phew"" I let out a sigh of relief. ""Thank god I'm not the protagonist"" I joyfully shouted as tears streamed down my cheeks. Wait, are you curious as to why I don't want to be the protagonist? I did forget to mention the most important thing when I was describing a protagonist. That is...They are calamity magnets. I just died.

Lucien was more than ready to embark in his new adventure to save a dying world from destruction as part of the Heaven's Gate Project.

However, just as he was about to be sent to the world that he was about to save, an accident happened, which forced his Patron God, the God of Gamblers, to take another gamble in order to preserve his chosen candidate's life.

Lucien, who's new identity was named Lux, found himself in a world where darkness could be light, and light could be dark. A world where morality was but a thin line from depravity, and a happy ending could only be gained, by facing the world and slapping it with a Legion of the Undying.

MMORPG : Rebirth Of The Strongest Vampire God ROTSVG,Raj_Shah_7152,Games,"# SYSTEM, # HAREM, # REINCARNATION, # OVERPOWERED, # APOCALYPSE, # ACTION, # VIDEOGAME, # ADVENTURE, # WEAKTOSTRONG, # COMEDY","In the year 2100 humanity was introduced to the revolutionary full dive VR game called 'Omega', however, the game was not a technology made by humans but one granted to humanity by a higher power to prepare them for the first awakening. 

It was only a tutorial and a means to smoothly transition the primitive species from thinking that they were alone in the entire universe, to being integrated into the true wide universe.

When the average user level in the game exceeded the predetermined threshold the tutorial finally ended and planet earth underwent a catastrophic event called the 'First Awakening ', as mana started to flow freely in the real world as it did in the virtual world and the real universal stage game called 'Sigma' was unveiled. 

'Sigma' was governed by the omnipotent A.I. the universal queen, and was the grand stage where races from all across the universe fought together for territory, resources, and honor. 

Set in a universe where fantasy races such as elves, dragons, and vampires are not a myth but real power players, humans quickly found out that they were one of the weakest races to play 'Sigma'.

In such desperate times, humans turned to their best professional players for salvation. 

--------------

Max, was a genius in the world of Omega and deemed the hope of mankind after the first awakening. However, an accident crippled his mana veins and caused him to be assessed as a manaless trash in Sigma! 

Deemed hopeless and irredeemable, he quickly went from hero to zero, and the world ignored him.

For ten years since the first awakening, he lived the life of a manaless trash and became a bottom feeder in society, slowly losing his pride, his possessions, and eventually his identity. 

In the end, he faced a tragic and painful death while failing to save his young nephew and niece from assailants. 

However, it was not the end of Max's story but just the beginning as he was reincarnated back in time to the day before the first awakening before his downfall started! 

Armed with the knowledge of the future, watch as Max reaches for the apex in his second life and fights against his destiny with grit and tenacity.

The more you focus on doing the art, the worse it becomes. Only when doing it becomes part of the art itself, does one truly experience it to its fullest.

You will know you understand only when you can't tell the singer from the song, dancer from the dance, and the daoist partners from the dao. This is true enlightenment in the art of dual cultivation 
...

The 'Naked Sword Art' is a personal skill of mine. It isn't perfect yet, but I believe it will one day be the greatest dual cultivation technique known to man.

I am the fucker of mothers, stripper of daughters, and the bane of all men and husbands alike. I am a blind dual cultivator.

Tang Shaoyang, an orphan who dropped out of the middle school to fight on the street as he found out school was useless for a penniless orphan like him.

Tang Shaoyang dropped out of his school, fighting on the street, and made a name for himself. Berserker Tang from Youyouliucun.

Afterward, Dragon Wing triad recruited him and everything was good for him. Even though the public deemed him as a tumor of society, Tang Shaoyang was having a decent life. Until one day, everything changed as an absurd and strange game started.

Dong!

""You may choose 3 Talents! please choose carefully!""

Tang Shaoyang held his chin and mused what Talent he had to choose.

""With Zombies appear everywhere, I need an infinite strength... this is one, I still need to choose 2 Talents more...""

Then a lewd smile formed on his lips.

""I want an infinite strength, charm and charisma to conquer women, and the last one, I want to upgrade my **** so I can please my women!""

After saying this, Tang Shaoyang laughed aloud.

""Hahaha, there's no way such talent exists... ehhhhh?!!!""

Journey of the Fate Destroying Emperor,LazySageDao,Eastern,"# CULTIVATION, # ROMANCE, # REINCARNATION, # OVERPOWERED, romance, reincarnation, cultivation","After being reincarnated in a world of Gods, Demons, and Great Emperors, Wang Wei embarks on a journey to bear Heaven Mandate, proves the Dao, and proclaims himself a Great Emperor--a Supreme Being that overlooked Myriad World and Races. However, his Dao involves despising fate and its encompassing glory. So what awaits our protagonist on his journey full of vicissitudes to defy and even control fate? While he controls the fate of countless races and worlds, is fate playing with him? Can he escape the very shackles of fate that he controls?

Better Synopsys:
After an unknown cosmic accident that enveloped the Earth, Wang Wei was reincarnated into a magical world of spiritual cultivation. This world was composed of powerful Demons, cunning and brutal Devils, ruthless and indifferent Gods, detached and ethereal Immortals. More Importantly, Great Emperors--Supreme Beings that stand above everyone and everything, even life and death itself.

Despite being born in one of the most powerful sects in the world, Wang Wei was placed under tremendous pressure when so many expectations were placed on him by his sect due to the fact they have not cultivated a Great Emperor for countless millennia--an act which threatened the fundamental status of his family, friends, and sect.

On top of that, Wang Wei was not one of the chosen few of this world that was granted special gifts by Heaven, thus further aggravating his circumstances.

However, he did not retreat in the face of adversity.

With the mindset that “If Heaven does not give me, I shall take it for myself”, Wang Wei begins to plan his rise to the top with a brilliant tactical mind and the help of his mysterious soul so that one day he will become a Great Emperor that not only control his fate but the fate of all lives in existence.


This story has a similar setting as Emperor Dominion, I am a True Villain, and Scoring the Sacred Body of the Ancients from the Get-go. If you enjoy this type of story, then you will enjoy my story.

The first 30 chapters or so have many problems story-wise, so please bear with it as I was just beginning as a writer. However, I promise the story gets better afterward.

Since he was a child, Isaac was unable to improve his strength no matter how much he tried, like he was cursed by the Gods.

One day, a massive snowstorm struck the peaceful city of Snowstar, wreaking havoc in a peaceful community. Young Isaac was wandering alone in the forest when the snowstorm struck, seeking adventures and excitement, but instead, he found something else that completely changed him and his future.

Several years later, Isaac suffered an incident caused by his jealous classmates, which bedridden him for several months, but after the traumatizing experience, doctors thought that it would take him years before he could overcome his trauma, but against all odds... He overcame it in 2 weeks!

Being heavily sheltered and protected by his family after the incident, Isaac's life seemed dull and kind of boring, but then... The highly anticipated VRMMORPG White Online was released. Without thinking twice, Isaac bought the cheapest VR Helmet available and entered the new world with almost zero expectations, but excited nonetheless.

This is the story of Isaac Whitelock, who will rise from being a protected and weak individual to being one of the sole hopes of the entire Human race.

The government gave up on the boy and allowed the scientists to use him as an experimental subject for their painful tests on the human bodies, but on the first test itself, Lucifer died. He saw the smile on the scientist's face even as he took his last breath. 

Was it truly the end?

But what happens when the boy truly awakens? What if he awakened not one, but more than four powers that were capable of destroying the world itself if used properly?

The strongest Warlock who could have been humankind's greatest protector was driven to become it's biggest enemy.


What happens when the boy that has awakened several powers at once starts seeking vengeance.

Can the protectors of humanity face the wrath of the Strongest Warlock? Can they stop the person who kills without blinking? Or are they destined to be swallowed by the Darkness they created?

Join the journey of the Most Powerful Warlock...

MMORPG : Rise of the Interstellar God ROTIG,Hamapo,Games,"# OVERPOWERED, # SYSTEM, # SUPERPOWERS, # REINCARNATION, # VIDEOGAME, # ADVENTURE, # CULTIVATION, # ACTION, # DARK, # MYSTERY","In the year 2100, global warming has long since made the Earth's natural surface uninhabitable with a new ice age. Humanity takes refuge in huge, closed cities, but life is difficult. Video games are the opium of the people, letting them escape the chaos of life in immense metropolises.

In 2100, the first fully immersive VRMMORPG, ""Horus,"" was released, and the world changed! Entirely coded by an independent AI, ""Horus"" made all other games look meaningless by comparison.

Megacorporations quickly monopolized on the wealth ""Horus"" allowed its players to amass, and soon people like Alexander were spending their lives slaving away to make money for the companies who employed them.

But on the day Alexander died of exhaustion, collapsing in his gaming booth...

...He woke up, alive, nine years earlier.

One day before ""Horus's"" launch.

""This time, I'll do it right! I know everything that's going to happen! I'll become the strongest, and no one will take advantage of me again!""

However, he committed a grave blunder by taking the fiction he had read as a reference. Reborn as a baby, he hoped to be deemed gifted by speaking early. 

One thing led to another, and tragedy struck. The villagers declared him a demon-possessed and called the church. Johnathan, now known as Sylvester Maximilian, realized that he had messed up.

Overwhelmed, they kneeled, thinking he was a messenger of Solis. 

From there, the story of how Sylvester Maximilian rose through the ranks to sit at the top began.

But his life won't be ordinary, as he uses his cunning and the tag of 'God's favored' to his advantage. Fighting treachery, unearthing secret plots and world mysteries, facing the darkness around him and creating his place in history, engraving his name in the annals to be forever remembered as the—Immortal Pope, The Young. 

[A/N: To not mislead you, the novel's name does not mean he instantly becomes the Pope from the start. The story will follow the life of MC. Though he will become the Pope at a pretty young age. 40% of the novel will be based around MC fighting to sit on the supreme throne.

If you enjoy world building and lore building, then you will like this story.]

Sky Ishiyama is a nerd with Photographic Memory who after the bumps and turns in his life, turned to be a Doomsday Prepper.

The story takes place in our world where our MC was diving through the Dark Web just for fun and discovered something that could only be found in books, movies, novels, manga, anime, or games.

Zombies, Walkers, Freaks, Infected, Biters, or whatever you may call them.

They're fucking real.

Ever wondered what you could do in a zombie apocalypse where you actually know what you're doing? Actually surviving properly while preventing stupid deaths? Doing what is right and necessary? Or better yet, actually doing what you shout in the monitor when you're watching a film?

Our MC is coupled with the knowledge of not just fighting z's but actually surviving by securing his home, finding allies, scavenging for supplies, building a community and so much more.

If you could, kindly like the tags I've put up and it would be huge, huge help for me, thanks in advance! Also, a comment, a review, or even a vote of a single power stone would help me out a lot! Thanks again!

Even though this world has the concept of science but it is not focused on electronics and industrialization like back on the earth, here the world has cards for every little thing's eliminating the need for electronics. 

This new world is highly focused on grimoire abilities such as Card creation and Card fusion. 

Coming to a world where money could buy him strength Dr. Wyatt had to earn money for his survival. 

But thanks to his otherworldly information and knowledge, card creation comes easily to Dr. Wyatt compared to other card apprentices.

On May 28, 2010, the world was forever changed by the third awakening. Suddenly, smaller worlds connected with the main world and beings of different races appeared, each with their own unique powers. The world was thrown into chaos as people tried to understand and control these newfound abilities.

But amidst all the confusion, towering structures began to appear all over the world. These towers held unimaginable power, and those who were already gifted with abilities could upgrade and become even stronger. Even those without powers could gain them through rigorous tests within the towers.

As expected, conflicts erupted across the globe as everyone scrambled to claim these towers for themselves. And at the heart of it, all was Luan Dimas, a man who had lived for a thousand years and had amassed an arsenal of techniques. He was transported back four months before the awakening, and now had the chance to correct his past mistakes.

Luan knew that he couldn't let this opportunity slip away. He had to make the most of this new chance and take control of the towers before anyone else could. But with so many others vying for power, the competition would be fierce, and the battles even more brutal.

With his knowledge and skill, Luan would have to fight his way through the chaos and overcome any obstacles in his path. The fate of the world hung in the balance, and Luan was determined to come out on top, no matter what it took.

But when Heaven used him in a scheme to get back at his father, Gravis realized that he needed strength to gain true freedom.

As long as he remained his weak self, he would always remain beneath Heaven’s oppression. Only true power brings true freedom.

To gain strength, Gravis ventured into the lower worlds to start his cultivation under true life and death tempering. 

Only a strong will, which had been forged in striving for every resource available, would allow him to reach the peak.

Heaven’s strongest weapon was Lightning of Divine Punishment, and only if he made this weapon his, would he have a chance.

So, to overthrow Heaven,

Lightning Is the Only Way!

Yet, the path to power is painful. 

Not everyone reaches the peak.

But Gravis will!

No matter how much pain he feels along the way!

But being a mediocre player who only knows how to gather information, he was put in a supporting role.

As the game explodes in popularity and every multibillion-dollar company invested in the game, things have turned for the worse for Ren. Due to the amount of information he gathered, the cheats, secrets, quests, and bugs he discovered, he was silent in fear of selling the information to the other guilds.

But given a second chance, he went back in time when his father was still alive and COVENANT was just in its starting phase.

This time . . . he wouldn’t be that guy on the side who gathered information from day in and day out for ten years. 

Equipped with the games knowledge he accumulated, he will become . . . an Alchemist!

Chrono Mage? Djin Master? Summoner? Necromancer?
Chaos Lord?

What good are those? 

Sure they’re powerful and rare classes and sought after by guilds, but it’s the alchemist who forged artifacts and concocts rare items and potions that gets the most coins at the end of the day!

It was better than being a blacksmith or a crafter! Plus, he could use all sorts of magic without limit to race and class!

The Witch Hunter System WHS,Pointbreak,Fantasy,"# R18, # HAREM, # SYSTEM, # MAGIC, # ACADEMY, # ACTION, # MYSTERY, # ADVENTURE, # TRANSMIGRATION","Dual cultivation isn't a choice; it's a necessity.

After being struck by a truck like most lucky protagonists (or unlucky ones), Vaan found himself transmigrated into the body of an orphan in the world of witches and demons.

However, they didn't always exist.

Demons terrorized the world ever since the Gehenna Realm descended over 300 years ago. but along with them, came mana, giving birth to witches to combat these demons.

Since then, the world of men was dominated by witches, establishing the seven witch kingdoms, which safeguards at the forefront of the demon invasion.

In order to survive in the matriarchal society of the witch kingdoms, Vaan, like all other men who cannot use magic, had to learn how to service the witches to survive.

Nevertheless, it did not come without its own benefits.

Years of research have led the world to the discovery of intimacy between men and women could increase the witches' mana absorption. 

But at the same time, men could absorb some of this mana to improve their physique and lifespan.

Thus, since then, an intricate relationship was formed between men and witches in the red-light districts. Love became casual, and dual cultivation is common.

As a prodigy in the art of pleasing women, Vaan lived a smooth two years since his transmigration as an orphan.

However, everything came crashing down in a heartbeat one day when his life was nearly taken, and Lady Eniwse whom he served went berserk.

Even so, that was not the end.

With the awakening of the Witch Hunter System, watch how Vaan takes on the world and becomes the lord of witches.

Void Evolution System VES,Crocs_is_Dead,Fantasy,"# SYSTEM, # EVOLUTION, # HAREM, # ADVENTURE, # ACTION","5 years ago, Earth was subject to an event now known as the “World Awakening”.

At that time, the world completely changed. Mana awakened in the world, gates began opening, and a holographic screen showed up in front of the eyes of every human that outlined their “status”. 

Each individual was given a talent to start with, ranging from simple abilities like enhanced eyesight to insane fantasy stuff like pyrokinesis.

And within this myriad of abilities, Damien awakened a spatial affinity with the skill “short-distance teleportation”. 

At first, he was excited, thinking about intense battles and gaining great power, but the reality was quick to shoot him down.

His ability only worked in the area 10 meters around himself, and his physical stats were insanely weak, leaving him tired after using his ability a couple of times. 

Disillusioned by his weakness, Damien lived a quiet life doing anything he could to meet ends meet, until one day, everything changed.

Damien was betrayed and thrown into a gate, left to fend for himself in a labyrinth of beasts. 

Something snapped in him that day. He refused to stay weak and keep his head down any longer.

When he emerged from the darkness, he found himself in a new world with no idea how to return to earth. 

However, he wasn’t the same kid he was when he first fell.

Quickly he and everyone else who bought the headsets found themselves in a world, not just a game. While realism is nice and all, the amount they were given was just too much...

Players started taking emotional tolls from playing the game, and when the company made a shocking announcement. This was amplified.

With terrifying analytical ability, inhuman reflexes, and monstrous reaction speed, Xie Feng's travel starts into a world that he will gradually discover is not as normal as it seems.

It was also from that moment that Xie Feng's life started to deviate from the norm, changing his destiny completely.

↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ 
Note: In chapter 4 it might seem that something is forced, but trust me when I say that it is not.
Everything has a logical reason, I just hope you continue reading to discover it!

Note to readers who dislike the harem: The harem in this novel will not be like in 99% of the novels where the protagonist only picks up girls madly. This harem has a logical reason and a specific destiny connecting the protagonist with the girls. Believe me, if it wasn't a harem, at the end of the story you would just cry.

____________________

I was just an ordinary guy, living a dull and unremarkable life as an editor.

But when a maniac author killed me for rejecting his novel in a writing competition, I reopened my eyes in a modern fantasy world.

""Hmm? Wait, this world….""

But fate, being a prude little bitch, played a twisted joke on me.

I reincarnated into the very same novel that I rejected for the competition award, written by the very same author who killed me for it.

Not only that, but I transmigrated into the body of a disowned noble named Lucas Morningstar.

Lucas was a minor antagonist in a novel who served as a stepping stone for the protagonist and their allies.

Arghh….

Of all the people, I just had to be reborn as someone who was despised by the main characters the most at this point in the story?

B-But hey, with my knowledge of the future and understanding of the main characters, I can at least live an easy life! 

Right...?

""Yeah, I can work with this!""

Or so I thought until I remembered the ending arcs of the book.

This world is destined for doom!

And not so long after, I started to realize that the novel and the world I transmigrated into might not be as similar as I had originally thought….

AN: MC is NOT a villain, so don't expect one. 

*The MC will seem a little bit (ok let's be honest, more than a little bit) foolish in the first 30-35 chaps but don't be fooled. 

I ask you to read the first 50 chapters before deciding to trash-talk the MC because that's where his borderline psychopathic strategist personality starts to surface.

At that moment, he knew that his lifelong friend had already betrayed him and sold him out. John was humiliated in front of hundreds of people and was forced to kneel in front of Thomas, the underworld assassin organization leader.

Within a few minutes, they beat him brutally, dragged him to some underground basement, and then locked him in a gloomy room.

°°°°°
Alexander Kael Touch, a self-made young billionaire, found his meteoric rise tragically cut short on a school trip. But fate had other plans, whisking him and his classmates away to a realm of swords and magic – a world where power manifested as unique: ''Gifts.""

While friends awoke to magnificent Gifts, Alex's Gift yielded only two enigmatic guns: one gleaming silver, the other shrouded in black. 

Worse, he couldn't use magic like his peers, drawing scorn and derision. Yet, fueled by an unyielding spirit and a burning dream, Alex refused to falter.

In this new world, he craved not wealth, but the strength to forge his own destiny. One goal burned bright: to rise once more, not to the peaks of financial power, but to the pinnacle of strength and control.

This is the chronicle of Alexander Kael Touch, the boy with two guns in a world of wonders. A tale of relentless struggle, forged in the crucible of mockery and doubt. A journey to the apex, where the scorned student will become the ultimate warrior.

Whispers of the ""Death Guns Master"" stir, echoes of a legend rising from slumber. The world may have forgotten them, but they are coming back.



 ††††††††††††

Nickaido's here with D-Guns, do not expect the smartest MC because he was once a billionaire, is still young, he has his flaws, he will learn and grow, so will the other characters. At the beginning other characters are stronger but worry not everything will change starting from around chapter 80 onward. Also sorry in advance because some of the female characters have strong backgrounds but it's for the sake of the future story, this book is just the start, I'm still improving. 

Sorry in advance, English is not my first language, so they may be grammatical errors and misspelled words. Please bear with me. I'm trying to improve to provide a better story. 

Starting from chapter 200th, I have started using Grammarly premium to help me with the English, so I think it's become better. As for the earliest chapters, I have started to re-edit them slowly; I will do more as I get more time. Maybe hire a professional editor when I can.

Once again, this is not some sophisticated story; it has many flaws, which I'm trying to learn from; however, this doesn't make the story less enjoyable. Would you please give it a try?

Expanding by millions of times its original size, its population was suddenly split into two halves. On one side, there was a group of technologically advanced humans. But, on the other, a world of cultivation had grown and pospered. The secrets that led to this change have been hidden in the darkness for too long... Until there came a day where a boy born on the Mortal side of the world was found to have the talent to enter the Martial side. Having lost both of his parents to a hidden tide, he chose to leave all that he had known behind and enter this land of danger. What truths would he unveil? What would he learn about what separated the Mortals from the Cultivators? What hidden evils wanted to ensure that his people never rose up and gained power? And how would those evils... deal with him?----This list of things I hate is quite long. The first is that I hate to be tested the most. The second is that I hate to be tested the most.

For those born of this colorless world to deem themselves worthy of casting judgement on me... I can only say that it's laughable. I am the Nameless Immortal God because even the Heavens themselves are unworthy to name me.

A.I. genius, Gengyo, through the assistance of SAPPHIRE attains the means to time travel. He seeks a simpler life, and wishes to experience the warmth of a family.
But often we do not get what we want, we get what we deserve. And his peaceful times soon end, as war storms Japan, and in order to protect his peace, he must conquer. Join Gengyo as he walks a blood-stained path toward absolute domination, seizing control of Japan.

//Brief extract from one of the battle scenes. Written from the point of view of a samurai landowner, Niwa Nakatane.

The hooves grew closer to Nakatane's position and their beating hearts grew faster.

Perhaps they could simply remain like that, hiding behind the tree, and allow these barbarians to pass? That way could they not return home to their families? Could they not give their dear wives one final kiss, or share one final story with their enthusiastic youth?

Nakatane knew exactly what they were thinking. And as the ground rumbled, and the mounted beasts howled, he was the first man to step out from the trees and make his stand.

""OORAH!""

Possessed by a furious energy, he thrust out with all the aggression of a war god, puncturing Ochi's stallion through the chest with the sharpened wooden point of his lengthy spear.

The mammoth fell from his mount clumsily, his head colliding with a nearby tree root. He ceased to move, and a pool of blood began to form around him.

""ARM THESE SPEARS MEN! VICTORY SHALL BE OURS!""

He stood in front of the charge of over 150 horsemen, alone. But he did not give a single inch of ground. He met the charge of the next man in line, roaring vengefully, possessed by all the rage and power that had accumulated in his body over these past years.

The horsemen shrieked like a pack of hyenas, fanning out, each eager for a piece of the man who had brought down their leader.

Our protagonist Alexander, gamer tag Astaroth, has always dreamt of becoming an E-Sports athlete. His parents supported his dream, but they are no longer of this world. He fully intends on making it in this new game, if not for him, then at least to honor their memory.

With no idea how he wants to play his character, Alexander chooses the most mysterious starting race. Will this be his road to success or his downfall? The game assistant certainly thought the latter.

""Do as you wish, young adventurer. I only wish to add this. Do not come back with complaints when you realize you have made the wrong choice,"" the elf said, looking at him with clear hatred.

""We will see about that,"" Alexander flatly replied. ""I love challenges,"" he added.

""Very well!"" the elf harrumphed. ""Have the adventure of your lifetime, as short as it will last,"" he sarcastically added.

Ahead of him lies an uncertain path, filled with trials and hardships. 

But one thing is clear in his eyes. He will become the strongest player in the game, even if he must step over mountains of corpses to do so.

Over are his days of working hard for nothing, it's make or break now!

I now have a discord where you can talk with other readers and me. There are also channels to discuss new weapons; characters; classes; or monsters that you might want to design and see incorporated in the story. I will always give credit to the person that created said thing, rest assured.

Supernatural Emergence happened.

Supernatural creatures start to come out of nowhere and forcefully claim half of the Earth and massacre any humans that cross their paths. All of them are too powerful, dozens of countries fall under their diabolic claws. Humanity was pushed against the corner.

But things started to turn around when humanity began to awaken magical powers.

Awakened is the name for those who awaken these powers blessed by the Gods, and they become the pillars of humanity. 

Rex Silverstar is a normal boy who has a traumatic experience. On the day of the Supernatural Emergence, a Werewolf takes everything he has. He lost his family and his home, left alone in this cruel world. What drives him to live every day is his deep hatred towards the Supernaturals.

Joining the military in the hope of helping exterminate the Supernaturals from an early age, he found out that it's impossible to kill the Werewolf that was responsible for killing his parents without being an Awakened.

On a fateful night, in a near-death experience, he's given a chance by the full moon.

It was the turning point of his life. Obtaining a System that allows him to become stronger, having the potential to match and surpass the Supernaturals, Rex was ecstatic until he saw his stats window.

""I'M NOT A WEREWOLF!!""

""Daily quest failed, sanity stat has been decreased by 20%!""

""Sanity stat is too low, you are unable to contain the blood moon blessing!""

Regret.

Valyr felt immense regret as he watched the world before him crumble into nothingness…

Just because they had lost the final battle.

Although he had already accepted the result before him, he still felt that it was wrong.

Holding onto his final strand of hope, he decided to wish to the heavens at his dying moment that he would get a second chance. 

A second chance, where, if everything turned out the same way, he would make sure their side won.

Fortunately for him… 

The heavens listened.

Reborn in the game where everything started and everything ended, Valyr quickly realized that he had been reborn not as a player.

Instead, he was now an NPC. An NPC of the game named Greater Beyond.

Bewildered at first, Valyr gradually began to adapt to his newfound circumstances, deciding to pursue the path of blacksmithing he chose in his previous life and use it to reach greater heights.

While doing so, he would make sure they would all be prepared for the final battle.

With that, witness Valyr’s journey to the peak as he eventually becomes…

The Primordial Godsmith of the Greater Beyond.

Although it always ends up with him winning, it always happens in an interesting (subjective) and fun way that makes me enjoy reading this.
The novel has elements of lighthearted comedy from time to time and I do chuckle at how direct the humor is.

Godfather Of Champions G.O.C,,Sports,"# REINCARNATION, # ADVENTURE, reincarnation, modern, adventure","This is a story about the pursuit of victory.

— ""I subscribe only to the theory of victory. I only pursue victory. As long as I am able to obtain victory, I don’t care if it’s total football or counterattack. What is the ultimate goal of professional soccer? In my opinion, it is victory, and the pinnacle of victory is to become the champions. I am a manager. If I don’t wish to lose my job or be forgotten by the people, there’s only one path for me to take, and that is to lead the team in obtaining victories, in obtaining championship titles!”

The main character was not well-liked by people.

— “⋯We conducted a survey which had been deemed by Manager Tony Twain as extremely meaningless. In a random street survey conducted, ninety-three percent of those surveyed chose the option ‘I hate Tony Twain’, while only seven percent chose the option ‘This person is rather decent, I like him’. It is worth noting that nobody chose the option ‘Who is Tony Twain? I don’t know him’. Mark, do you know why Manager Twain felt that our survey was very meaningless?” Parker, a reporter from <The Daily Telegraph> laughed loudly and said when he was being interviewed by BBC.

But there were also people who were madly in love with him.

— “⋯ Became the spokesperson of world-wide famous clothing brands, shot advertisements, frequented the fashion industry’s award ceremonies, endorsed electronic games, has a supermodel girlfriend. His earnings from advertisements exceed his club salary by seventeen times, owns a special column in various print medias, publishing his autobiography (in progress), and is even said that he is planning to shoot an inspirational film based off his own person experiences! Who can tell me which part of his life experiences is worthy of being called ‘inspirational’? Hold on⋯. Are you all thinking that I’m referring to David Beckham? You’re sorely mistaken! I’m talking about Manager Tony Twain⋯.”

He was very knowledgeable about Chinese soccer.

— “⋯ I’ve heard about it, that Bora gifted four books to his manager Mr. Zhu before your country’s national team’s warm up match. After which, the team lost 1:3 to a nameless American team from Major League Soccer. The new excuse that Mr. Zhu gave for losing the match, was that Bora gifted “books” (‘books’ and ‘lose’ are homophones in the Chinese language). Here, I recommend that you guys find out what that one specific book is. Which book? Of course the one that caused you all to score a goal. After that, tell me the title of the book. Before every match, I will gift ten copies of that same book to you. In that case, won’t you all be able to get a triumphant 10:0 win over your opponents every time?” An excerpt taken from Tony Twain’s special column in a certain famous Chinese sports newspaper.",https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/10200827905004405?imageMogr2/thumbnail/150&imageId=1547636455824

A whole new world of mystery and wonder awaits, 
As we turn the corner...
------
The Sacred Ruins
Is a story set in a post-apocalyptic world. A world that has recovered to a state that is roughly equal to our own world in terms of technology and culture, although its ancient history remains largely unknown. The story begins during the post-graduation trip of our protagonist, where he discovers some ancient ruins and witnesses “the great change”, an upheaval that changed everything. The changing earth not only brought about new, unexplored landscape but also sparked the evolution of all organisms. Plants and animals started gaining sentience and some humans obtained unimaginable powers. The legends, myths, and tales of old seemed to have suddenly come to life as the earth entered a new era where beasts and men formed factions, explored new lands and ultimately struggled for supremacy.
We follow the MC as he grows from being an eccentric young man into a badass expert warrior while meeting other funny characters and forming brotherly bonds. We watch as he falls into just as much hilarious situations as he does perilous ones, all the while wondering and slowly discovering the mysteries of this world. Just why was the world destroyed in the first place? Who or what had triggered this earth-shattering “change”? What profundities lie behind the process of evolution?

ryuxenji the translator here. :3 Here are some other things you should know:
 
1) This story is NOT primarily a romance. QI's system right now categorizes all novels taken from the female novel Chinese site (起点女生网) as 'romance' without fail, regardless of whether they truly are romance. So, if you are here just for the romance, you might want to find a different novel. There will be some romance eventually, but most of this novel is Sci-Fi/Xianxia with a lot of world-building and character development.
 
2) I use British spelling. So, please ensure spelling errors are really errors before reporting them.
 
3) No matter what the release rate up top says, the guaranteed release rate right now is 1 chp/day (a.k.a. 7 chps/week). All else is extra at my discretion.

Translator Review:
This is a novel encompassed with mystery, ethics, family ties, and romance. Of course, the highlights of this book are the murder cases. 
Although it’s a modern setup where none of the characters have a system or any other cheats, the Author managed to delight me with her writing, creative plots and a good pace without dragging her story. 
I marvel at the way the Author links up the clues and plot to explain the individual cases as well as paving the way to unravel the huge conspiracy behind the individual murders. Romantic plots are light-hearted so readers could take a breather from the plots of gruesome murders.

After risking being a hostage in a foreign country, she returned five years later to find that she no longer had a place in his imperial harem. Lying in his arms, the new consort said with a sneer, “Sis, now that the country is stable, it’s time for you to die.” 
Her daughter died a tragic death and her son was removed as crown prince. The Shen family had been loyal, but they ended up being slaughtered.
Shen Miao never thought that their marriage and mutual support all this while would end up being just an act Prince Ding put on! Prince Ding said, “On account that you’ve been with me for twenty years, I’ll allow you to die with your entire body intact. Now you may thank me and hang yourself to death.”
Before she hung herself, Shen Miao made a resentful oath, “When I perish, I will haunt you day and night!”

Yun Xi and Yun Lian are twins, but because Yun Xi was always been better in her studies and had a better husband, both society and their parents showed their bias toward Yun Xi. However, Yun Xi would always tolerate and dote on Yun Lian, giving Yun Lian most of her opportunities, including the precious chance to go to school. Staring at her husband’s icy expression, Yun Xi dragged her sickly body to the window and jumped down. 
When she opened her eyes, Yun Xi realized that she was not dead. Instead, she had returned to that summer day when she was competing with Yun Lian for an opportunity to go to school. It was on this day that Yun Xi offered her most precious opportunity! Now that she was given another chance at life, Yun Xi swore to take back what was hers. Whatever Yun Lian took from her, she would have Yun Lian pay everything back! As for her ex-husband, Mo Ran, Yun Xi decided to let Yun Lian have him. Yun Xi did not want him anymore. However, the new Yun Xi, who had now become more aloof instead of her old humble self, was further loved by the world. Even that unattainable man started paying her attention?!",https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/22478427806799305?imageMogr2/thumbnail/150&imageId=1645068600388
