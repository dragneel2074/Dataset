If you are looking for a story with a submissive, all-forgiving female lead, this is not the novel for you.

*****

She smirks, before asking “do you like that, my little mate?”. I’m too far gone to even care about the “little” part now, all I want is her tongue back where it was a second ago. “Yes..” I manage to breathe out, before she licks it again, and shortly wraps her lips around my tip. F*ck. I moan, shivering when she pulls back. “Say please, my little mate” she taunts, her eyes still glued to mine and her hand still pleasuring me. “Please Lola” I breathe out. And just like that, she wraps her mouth around the tip, before taking in my c*ck until it hits the back of her throat. We both moan loudly, and I close my eyes momentarily in pure ecstasy. I almost whimper when she pulls it out again to say “look at me while I please you”. I comply immediately, and she grins before continuing her delicious torture. Her other hand moves to play with my balls and I know I’m not going to last long. I’m panting and moaning like a hot mess, when I hear Lola’s moaning increase.

I quickly avert my eyes back to Lola’s, not wanting to risk her to stop as I am so close to coming undone now. I can’t believe this is all happening. “I… I’m cumming” I croak out, when I feel I’m about to topple over. She pulls her mouth off, and immediately places my c*ck between her perfect breasts. Goddess this is hot. I move up and down slowly, as my c*m starts to cover her breasts. “F*ck you are perfect” I breathe out in between my pants and moans. Lola is moaning louder and louder, as she is probably on the verge as well.

*****

Lola is an omega within the Red Dagger pack. She was found as a baby abandoned in the woods by her adoptive mother, who has long passed by now. Lola is not your typical submissive she wolf. She is sassy, with anger issues bubbling just beneath the surface. With her curvy body, blonde hair and green eyes she is the total opposite of all the other wolves appearance wise. And as a result, is treated like an outcast after her best friend Chris – the alpha heir – turns on her without warning as young children. Ignored by almost everyone and bullied and beaten by her former best friend and his gang daily, Lola long awaits the day and year she turns 18 when she gets her wolf and is able to finish high school to leave Red Dagger. All she has to do is withstand one more schoolyear of it all, despite the constant desire to fight back and the struggles to reign in her anger. But what happens when the bucket runs over and her restraint finally snaps? What happens when she faces off those who have tormented her for years, thinking she is a weak little girl, although she has been secretly training hard for years on her own?

As the story unfolds, she will come across those who desire her as well as her fated mates – the Lycan princes. Lola has never wanted a mate and after all betrayals is reluctant to trust anyone anymore – but will she let any of them in eventually? And what happens when her wolf is revealed and her origins are questioned when she gains special powers? Will she find her happy ever after with a mate, her fated mates, or stay alone?"

Link to the original book:：https://www.dreame.com/story/3728482816-te-quiero-de-vuelta-

I was forced to marry the coldest, most ruthless, and most arrogant billionaire man in the entire country just because of a contract my father made. He married me because of what my family represents. With recognition, social status, respect, and power, our companies merged, becoming the most powerful in the entire business community. We are partners with the same duties and rights. There is nothing better than a wedding between the most powerful families in the country, but there's only one problem: Angel Leffman hates me. I am the woman who ruined his life, and I'm just his wife in the contract. We barely exchanged words, and when we did, we argued like cats and dogs who couldn't stand each other, but in front of the country, we were the perfect couple. Now he has everything; he doesn't need me anymore and wants a divorce. But there is a bigger problem... I have always loved him, but my pride is worth more than him.

My family was the most powerful, along with hers, but we did not have the business power that their name alone gave us. That did not matter to me in the least, but for my family, it did. I was in love with the perfect woman in the world, but that changed when I was forced to marry the most stubborn, proud, and cold woman, Sofia Andrew. We have been living a farce of a marriage for five years, but now that I have everything, I don't need her anymore. Elisa, the woman I love, is back, and she is getting in my way. It's time to change things, get her out of my life, and start a new life with Elisa, but it's not as easy as it sounds.

She loves him, but he will never know, as he always despises her for something she didn't do. He hates her, so how can he forgive what she did? How can he possibly love her after that?

Marriage wasn't their beginning, and divorce wasn't their end because their story was just about to begin.

“You are so naughty, Scott,” the she-wolf Sarah chuckled.

“Only for you, babe,” he replied, muffled as her lips closed around his.

“Oh, Scott. Stop it. You know we can’t be seen together. What if your girlfriend finds us?”

“She’s in class. She’s never late. You don’t need to worry.”

“Lila?” Scott breathed, staring at me in shock “What are you—”

He went easily, though his eyes showed nothing but confusion. I closed my eyes tightly so I wouldn’t have to see his expression any longer.

Later, I walked into my class but found,

Sixteen-year-old Harley Ashwood wanted to get through high school without running into the two boys who ignited her soul with anger and curiosity. It isn’t until they reject her as their Goddess-given mate and force her to vacate the only home she has ever known that Harley learns her self-worth and what she is truly capable of.

Ten years later, she is forced to return to The Clearwater pack when her parents are murdered in a rogue attack. Will her newfound fire light a spark between the three, or will Harley finally have the guts to accept their rejection?

What will happen to the trio when The mysterious King of the Damned comes to town, offering a big payout for the retrieval of the Mark of the Moon?

In the midst of all hell breaking loose, will Harley find a way to save the future of her pack, or will the rogues and vampires destroy Clearwater for good?

Go on this wild ride of love and chaos to find out the future of Clearwater and see if Harley will get her happily ever after, after all.

Part 2:

Normal. Ordinary. Boring even. That was me. I was all of those things. A regular, everyday, naive eighteen-year-old girl... Until I wasn't any of those things anymore.

I let myself be fooled and manipulated by a piece of sh*t until nothing was left of me, of the sweet girl I tried so hard to keep alive. But I couldn't. I couldn't preserve her innocence or her excitement over dancing in the rain and to think... It all started with a kiss.

One kiss against a bookshelf in an empty library would be the first of many steps leading me to the end. Or maybe it was the beginning?

The beginning of a new start somewhere between heaven and hell, a tender in-between that feels like a fever dream. A realm where dragons fly in the sky, and mermaids swim in the seas. A home where death makes coffee in the mornings and the king tattoos a fresh start on my undiscovered skin. But what happens when that fever dream becomes a hellish nightmare? What happens when that sweet naive part of me that was taken glides into the nowhere?

What happens when she becomes so bitter and angry that not even the sickeningly sweet taste of revenge can sate her starvation?

Will the king come in on his white horse like a knight in shining armor to save me from myself, or will death restore the pieces of my soul and make me whole again?"

When a one-night stand puts Giada in the crosshairs of the Don’s only heir, Cipriano Amato, Giada knows the best way to get what she wants is to remove him from the equation and plots to have him sent away. Planting ideas and making sure she’s there to pick up pieces, Giada spends ten years making sure the Don considers her invaluable in his son’s absence.

Giada’s plans fall into place, until for the first time in her life, she begins to consider there might be more to life than being a soldier in the upper echelons of a mafia family.

That is until the prodigal son comes home, and her boss puts a target on her back. When the Don of her family tells Cipriano he’s going to name Giada Donna if he can’t get his act together, he decides the best way to keep his title is to make Giada his woman. He makes it clear, he wants her at his side to rule his family.

Suddenly Giada finds herself torn between keeping the career she’s worked ruthlessly to have and sticking with Cipriano or giving it all up for her heart with Baldasarre. Love or career? What’s a girl to choose?"

“I heard they haven’t found their mates yet.”

“Why couldn’t it be me?”

Now I was even more curious. When they went out with the plates, I tiptoed up to the swinging door. While everyone was distracted by the servers, I pushed the door open just a crack and peeked through into the formal dining room.

By bad luck, the two men in question had their backs to me. They sat straight and tall, one in a dark red shirt, one in a light blue shirt. The red shirt had long hair pulled back in a pony tale. The blue shirt had a short, deliberately messy style.

I couldn’t tell much from the backs of them except they seemed well muscled. I was just about to back out of the door when I was hit with the most tantalizing odor.

It overpowered the spicy scent of my jambalaya and made me almost dizzy… I tried to put a name to it… sandalwood, sweet cedar, and s*x. Do I even know what s*x smells like? I was frozen and couldn’t move from the door.

At the same time, the two men stiffened in their chairs and seemed to be looking around in confusion.

Luna looked around them and saw me in the door way. Her eyes burned like fire into my skull and I finally snapped out of the trance I was in and slipped back into the kitchen.

I was never supposed to be seen in the dining room – so my indiscretion would no doubt earn me a belting later. I went back to the clean up with a heavy heart."

Then she meets Elijah, who is so different from Jack. More brains than brawl, bookish rather than sporty, he is kind and honorable and is the perfect gentleman. He is also rather observant which unnerves her because she is still pretending not to speak. Slowly but surely, she starts to fall for him...but then Jack returns, not willing to let her go, and begs for a second chance so they might continue their dream together."

At the time, I never gave them much thought. Thinking they were just that… stories. Growing up, I soon realized that they weren’t lofty fantasies and fairy tales, but memories of her past, memories of our ancestors before our world turned to s**t. You see, what comes from legend, no matter how exaggerated the story becomes, there is always a sliver of truth. You just need to weed out the fiction from fact.My grandmother used to tell me stories of the Chosen One. The one who would save us all. When I was younger, I used to believe that what she said was true. That eventually someone would be born, just as the Oracle predicted. Someone who could save our souls and bind us back to our magic. Once I grew up and saw the world unfolding around me, I no longer believed in salvation. The chosen one seemed to be more of a prayer than reality. Some dream we wanted desperately to come true. Something for which we all prayed and prayed. Something in which we needed to find hope when there wasn’t any left. When our ancestors turned their backs on us, how were we expected to believe in this so-called salvation? Especially when all we witnessed was death and c*****e ever since the great war. Nothing except pain and poverty. I used to believe the stories, used to pray for the mysterious chosen one that would rid our world of its evil. Now though, I see it for what it really is, just a dream of hope. Some out of reach fairy-tale. A story to create hope. Hope is dangerous; it makes you believe things will get better.

“You will NOT c*m yet, understand Little One?”

Hearing him say this makes me almost fall over the edge. I can barely form a coherent thought, let alone words.

Suddenly, I feel a hard smack on my ass.

I gasp at the impact, it’s hurts so damn good.

“Answer me, Little One.” He growls in my ear

“YES, DADDY! I UNDERSTAND!”

I feel myself starting to fall apart. My legs are shaking uncontrollably and the tears are running continuously down my cheeks.

“Hold on baby, just a little bit longer.”

I nod my head vigorously.

“Daddy, please!” I beg. I don’t know if I’m begging him to stop or to keep going until my last breath.

Then suddenly his fingers are gone. Almost immediately my body weeps from their absence.

“Open.”

I do as instructed and open my mouth. He inserts the same two fingers he was just ravishing me with allowing my tangy sweetness to coat my tongue.

I drink down my juices hungrily, I feel as if I’m going insane."

My sister Renee is a beauty, for sure. Everybody knows it, and so does she.

Did I fail to mention that Renee and I are, emphatically, NOT identical twins? We look nothing alike. She’s gorgeous, petite, delicate, and feminine. All she has to do is blink her big blue eyes, and the world falls at her feet.

She is also a bit of a wild child. That is why Father had me chaperone Renee when she decided to head out to Prosperity Springs to meet up with the Salvador Twins.

Unless…unless my father was trying to pass us off as a package deal? A two-for-one, twin-on-twin special. The idea made me throw up in my mouth a little bit. I wasn’t interested in finding a mate, or two, or five, or whatever. And those gorgeous guys wouldn’t be interested in Renee’s spare. It would just be an embarrassing situation for everyone involved.

Why? Because I’m Olivia, the ugly sister.

With Renee filling the center of a s*x sandwich, it was pretty clear she didn’t need me around. Hell, even the Alpha had noticed how alluring she was.

Of course, the alpha would be charmed by my sister. Of course, his eyes would become heated when they followed that plunging neckline down between her breasts. Every red-blooded man did, and behind his powerful alpha status, Josiah was still just a man. Heck, even hot-blooded women couldn’t avert their eyes from my sister.

""I can't do this. I can't deal with all this. You all have toured me so much that I'm sure you will make my life a living hell if I stay here as your mate,” I said, trying hard to control my tears.

“What do you mean by that?” Philip asks anxiously.

I stared at the three of them for a few minutes before saying what I had to say..

“I, Emma Garcia, refuse Julian Martinez, Philip Martinez, and Alexander Martinez as my mates. I refuse to accept them,” I finished, crying profusely. I saw their eyes widen in shock.

Growing up as an Orphan and an omega, Emma is subjected to bullying especially from her pack's Alpha's triplet sons and their best friend the Beta's daughter.

Amory is the youngest of all 12 of the Morningstar children. She's been feisty her entire life with an attitude straight from Hell. Mo lived her whole life with a power that other people either didn't understand, or didn't believe.

Seer's died off thousands of years ago, yet Mo is able to see the future. She went through her life being used to no one believing her unless she proved them wrong. That gave her a sort of attitude that made her not want to be honest with anyone.

Because Mo isn't just a Seer. Her power's go far beyond just being able to see the future. Something that only one other person knows.

Kee.

The two Morningstar's that you can't keep a secret from are Kee and Mo. Which means, they can't keep secrets from each other either. Mo catches wind of what her sister is up to in Hell, and she wants a part of it.

Mo is sick of everyone underestimating her. She's sick of not finding anyone strong enough to put up a real fight with her. Mo is an already angry girl surrounded by people wanting to put her down every chance they get.

And the worst part... She already knows who her mate is. Mo might not know his name, what he is, or where he is, but she knows him. She knows that he's going to be a complete a.sshole to her. Mo knows that her mateship is doomed before it's even begun.

However, when Kee's plans start to grow, she sends her little sister out on an important mission. Go to the Dragon Kingdom, and force King Cadmus into signing a treaty with them.

Little do either of them know, Cadmus is no longer the king. After all of these years, he's stepped down, and handed the throne to his son, Prince Caidian.

Caidian is extremely fond of the Morningstar family after what Kee did for him. When he first learns of why Mo is there, he's ready to sign any treaty that Kee has sent his way. Anything for his personal hero.

When Caidian first lays his eyes on Mo, however... Things quickly change. The unruly and grumpy Dragon just found his favorite new play thing. Something to keep him occupied for the rest of his long life.

This something... just so happened to be his mate.

Unfortunately for the Dragon King, his mate doesn't seem to want him at all. All Mo wants is for him to sign the treaty so she can leave. She doesn't care about being mated in the slightest.

This pi.sses Caidian off to no end. He doesn't care what he has to do. Amory Morningstar will be his.

My mom had just gotten through her speech about how we need to listen closely to her today and not leave her side, much to my brothers' annoyance. It was only a moment later when her eyes glazed over and her expression changed from commanding Luna to a fearful mother.

""Mom?"" I asked.

""Run, we need to run!"" She whisper-yelled to my brother and I. No sooner had she said it, fire began to spread through the pack. Fear took over my body and I stood stunned in place trying to process what was happening. My mother quickly picked me up and began to run with my brother following closely next to her. Everything happened so fast. Seth took a sharp left turn, heading towards our border, undoubtedly where our father had gone off too. I think my mom yelled at him. I was too distracted looking at our home going up in flames. I felt her put me down and finally snapped out of it when she told me to run again.

""Head north and don't look back!"" She yelled, pushing me in the correct direction before she took off in the direction of Seth.

With a final longing stare, I took off, heading north as fast as my feet could carry me. It wasn't until I was about to cross our pack border that I saw a scary-looking man facing my direction. He was enormous, much taller and bigger than a normal werewolf. Was he a Lycan? The smoke was making it hard to breathe, my lungs begging for clean air. I didn't know what to do but to keep running.

The agreement that Alicia and Iesha integrated with Matlock, until she could lead Edensor herself was approved by the Royal Family. However Alicia's plight goes unnoticed, and she blames the royal's for not caring about the plight of an Alpha wolf, being mistreated. She believes they only care for mistreated Omega's and humans, and both Alicia and Iesha are forgotten.

Prince Asher Colton is the heir to the werewolf throne, he loves life, and is often mischievous. Some mistake the prince's fun loving personality as weakness, however, when needed Asher is more than capable at proving what a good, strong and powerful leader he is. On a Royal visit to some packs, Asher comes to Matlock pack, and soon realises all is not what it seems. He is left heartbroken that the plight of two girls has gone unnoticed, never more so as Alpha Alicia Wilson is his mate.

Will Alicia find it in her heart to forgive the Royals, for not understanding her plight? Or will the strong willed 18 year old reject the Alpha Prince, and turn away from her destiny as future Queen?"

I get in the car with Mr Happy, and three other people who seem much more friendly they all introduce themselves to me, it’s nice they are not all assholes.

“just so you know, I didn’t want this marriage, and I didn’t want you. There will be rules when we get back to the pack. We won’t be sleeping in the same room, you have no say in my life or my pack, and you stay out of my life” he growls.

“My my aren’t you charming and such a catch” I taunt, causing a couple of choked laughs “for starters I didn’t want this either I wasn’t given a choice, I am happy to stay away from you we can reject each other you can sleep with whoever you want and so can i” I sneer at him.

“How dare you, who do you think you are a worthless wolfless girl, thinking you are better than me” he roars.

I sit and laugh at him“if that’s what you want to think, fine by me, I was just trying to sort the best solution for both of us according to your charming rules” I say condescendingly.

“I will decide if there is to be any rejection, not you. I make the rules, and you follow, do I make myself clear” He shouts.

“Oh crystal clear Alpha, anything else sir” I sneer.

“Just f*****g sit there quietly. I can’t be bothered with you for now” he growls. We spend the rest of the journey in silence.

Athena is sad and whimpering in my head about her mate being horrible and wants to let him know she is there. “no we can’t tell him, he doesn’t want us, if we have a wolf or not it won’t make a difference he’s an asshole” I warn her“what will we do Aurora” she asks“survive and not put up with anyone’s sh.it” I say firmly “we are much stronger than they realise we won’t let them drag us down” I add.

Author Note:

I’ll like to make a point before you proceed ahead. ‘Alpha Triplets Claim’ storyline is based on the very first novel I read by a talented author know as Eva Zahan and the storyline is from her book ‘Ace’s Trap’. Despite having the same sequence in the beginning the book has a different storyline and I wanted to bring it to the reader’s attention. I also want to let everyone know I’ve asked the author before hand if I can use her idea and she has agreed. I have the conversation with the author on my page [H.A Shah Readers] for anyone wanting to confirm before going ahead."

To look at beautiful, confident, eighteen-year-old warrior, Bellamy Carrington, one would never expect the dark tragedies that had formed her. The blood spilled, the lives lost, the pain and hopelessness that shaped her childhood.

Orphaned at six, the young rogue born alpha vowed vengeance on the men who took her parents from her. The men who stole happiness and love from her life. And she did.

Training under the tutelage of vampires, witches, rogue wolves, and other shapeshifters, for six years; Bellamy became a deadly and formidable force in the supernatural world. But, no one is perfect.

After killing the hunters, she was captured by a dark witch. Beaten, poisoned, collared in silver, and slated for sacrifice in one of the witch’s spells. Bellamy made one last push for life and escaped.

She was hopelessly lost, in pain, weak, and broken in so many ways. Bellamy gave up. She decided her death would be on her own terms. Fate had other ideas.

A young future pack Alpha found her, half-drowned, in a pond and saved her life. He didn’t care that she was a rogue. Warrick of the Hunter’s Moon Pack only cared about preserving the life of the little girl.

Warrick helped her find the life she deserved. He found her an adoptive family and became a true and compassionate friend to her. Valuing her strengths and supporting her completely.

Bellamy found new purpose, new hope, and a new life. All she was missing was what she saw her friends and pack mates finding every day. Love, a mate, someone to be entirely hers.

She never thought she'd find a male worth offering for, until she allowed herself to be taken captive by vampires. When she met the man who could change everything. The other half of her broken heart."

Laurel was living the Cinderella life in the worst way possible. Her father left after her mother's death, brought home a stepmother and quickly formed a family of his own. Laurel was casted aside and treated as dirt.

The string of fate was holding her together in hopes that her mate might be someone she could life for.

The hope was taken away from her when the mate she waited for happened to be someone her stepsister liked.

Laurel was rejected without a second thought and shipped off to become an offering to the dangerous Alpha of Crimson moon pack in her stepsister's place.

""You belong to me from the moment my eyes met yours. I will be your home and family. Never again will I let you feel pain. Love is all you will remember. Yes, I want you just as you are.""

Darius had little knowledge of anything that wasn't related to his pack. Mate was simply a distraction that he didn't need. With his eyes on the army and pack, he thought not looking for a mate won't get him one.

Until Laurel was delivered to him by silver moon and they crossed paths in the most unconventional way he could have imagined. His life took an unexpected turn when he found himself drawn to her without any way to control those growing feelings for the broken girl.

The catch? She didn't feel the bond that he felt. Was it a punishment for not wanting her before meeting her?

Those were not enough to stop Darius from claiming his mate. He was determined to keep Laurel to himself.

Mysteries were uncovered and soon Darius discovered that his mate wasn't as simple as she looked. And she herself wasn't aware of what ran in her blood and what her mind could do."

""Please, let's try again. We can make another baby right now if you want,"" I begged, my voice broken and desperate.

""A slut like you doesn't deserve a second chance,"" he spat, his words like venom cutting through my heart like a knife had stabbed my chest.

""I love you."" I whispered, despite his harshness, feeling my heart bleed internally from pain and my wolf slowly vanishing due to heartbreak.

""I, Alpha Liam, reject a lowlife slut like you, Ruby, as my Luna and true mate,"" he said, pushing me away with a force that sent me crashing to the floor. The impact was brutal, and unintentionally, my head collided with a concrete table. The world blurred, and as darkness closed in, I felt the weight of his rejection and the physical pain intertwining—a cruel symphony of agony—before everything went silent.

************

Ruby once had the most perfect life any she-wolf could ask for; with a loving mate by her side and a baby on the way, what else could she want? However, her whole world turned upside down right in the delivery room, and she faces a cascade of heartbreaks.

Life seemed to have given her a second chance at happiness until she got rejected for the second time openly, in the most disgraceful way, and thrown away like dirt, sending her back on the verge of tears.

Seven years later, with her son all grown up and getting accepted into the biggest werewolf academy that was owned by her ex-mate, she is forced to go back to her previous life and face her nightmare all again. But this time she is going back stronger and better for the sake of her child.

But what happens when she returns and finds her mate regretful and remorseful—and not just that she crosses paths with her second chance mate—the new strongest alpha in town who also has a little daughter?

Would she forsake her quest for revenge by accepting her first mate and childhood love for the sake of her child and having the perfect family she had once dreamed of, or would she explore the new spark of connection with the second chance mate, the powerful alpha?"

I lost everything at age five- my parents, my position in the pack, and my desire for love and happiness. It is safe to say I haven't belonged anywhere since my brother was born.

All I am good for at home is the chores I have to do and cleaning up after my thirteen-year-old brother, Benjamin, or Ben for short.

""So, you are turning eighteen. I hope you leave home and stop embarrassing me. My friends say you are weird,"" Ben says.

""What? No happy birthday?"" I say sarcastically.

""Whatever! You are a loser. Look at you! You always wear black and have that ring in your nose! You never show your face, and no one cares about you! You wear too many clothes! The other girls always wear dresses and stuff, but you wear jeans and hoodies,"" Ben says.

The CEO’s Contracted Mistress

When Bobbie Caron was twenty-one years old, billionaire tycoon Olivier Villeneuve had swept into her world and flipped it upside down. With her sister dying in a care home, when he made her the offer to spend thirty days with him for sixty thousand dollars, she knew she couldn’t refuse. Then he had double-downed and extended her contract by another thirty days. The charming charismatic man with the filthy tongue easily had Bobbie eating out of his hand and stealing her heart.

Just shy of the sixty-day mark, with Olivier away on business, she finds out he has not only abandoned her in their hotel suite, but he’s passed her contract on to someone else to finish out. With the help of a security agent, she made her escape, but the damage was done. The realization she had almost been s*x-trafficked by the man she had fallen in love with was devastating. She turned tail and ran as far away as her bank balance would allow.

Olivier Villeneuve was a financial genius with a love for numbers unlike anything else. When he sets eyes on a gorgeous blonde barista, he knew he had to have her. When he returns from his trip to his family’s estate to learn she’d run off with his security agent, he was incensed. Nobody takes what is his and makes a fool of him in the process. He spends nine years searching for them both.

When Olivier is seated in his hotel his eyes clash with a set of familiar eyes and all bets are off. He will do anything to get Bobbie back in his bed, including demand she finishes out the five days of her contract she never fulfilled. When the man realizes the children, she is traveling with, are not her employer’s kids but his, twins with his eyes and his cocky smirk, he’s found his key to success. He’s going to have his contracted mistress back with the bonus of his babies, whether she likes it or not.

For Bobbie the problem isn’t whether she likes it, it’s whether her heart can survive another round as the CEO’s contracted mistress. All’s fair in love in war, until it isn’t. When the truth comes out, how far will Olivier go to protect what is his and can Bobbie survive the fallout?"
